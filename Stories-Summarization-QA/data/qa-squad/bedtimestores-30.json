          "context": "Emily Buggs awoke suddenly around 2 a.m. She wanted the feel of fresh air on her skin because she was drenched in sweat and spittle, and her satin nightie clung to her petite body. Her home, an ancient structure purchased at a 40% discount by her husband two years ago, was a brick structure that was either too hot or too cold.She rose slowly from her king-sized bed, her sheets rumpled, and put on her best pair of flip flops. She opened her window, which faced a small bush behind their fence, and felt compelled to eat. She had formed a bad habit of eating her favourite cereal, HEX, at odd hours for several weeks. She saw the golden brown package in the shopping centre three weeks ago and decided to give it a shot. She was hooked after she tried it. There was nothing special about it. The vanilla flavor was bland, but she adored it. Every meal left her wanting more. She had eaten around 14 boxes of cereal.She took the bowl of cereal into her room and sat by the window to slowly eat it. Brett, her husband, was out of the country on work. She was completely alone. She was on her fifth spoon when she found something out of the ordinary. Her heart stopped because it was so weird. The golden brown cereal particles began to turn a deep red colour. Her hands shook violently, as if she had been electrocuted. When she sensed a presence, she threw the bowl over the window and began to close the curtains.Unfortunately, she was unable to move. Her feet were firmly planted on the wooden board. Although she couldn't see it, she could feel and smell it as it got closer. What was going on with her? She tried to move again, but she was transfixed.When they first moved in, they found some gaps in the walls as well as how damp the house was. The plumbing system was also a disaster. When she would turn on the kitchen sink faucet, the water would be filthy. They tried everything they could to come up with a solution, but nothing helped. Sue, an African-American woman in her forties, tried to tell her secretly, but she didn't believe her, neither did her husband. She mentioned a young maid dying in that home, but Emily laughed and said she didn't believe in ghosts. Sue cautioned her to be alert since no one had stayed there for more than a month. She had laughed at that silly story that Sue shared with her. Her house was a little odd and spooky, but not haunted. She advised Sue to stop watching too much movies and face reality. Ghosts didn't exist. Besides,she and her husband had been there for more than two years which further proved that her neighbours were wrong. She noticed a crack in the glass. When she looked in that direction, she noticed three long claws that resembled skeletons scratching the glass. She couldn't take her gaze away. Slowly, the word HEX became visible. Was she having hallucinations, or was the cereal evil? If she were still alive, her husband would not believe her when she told him the story.When she looked up, she noticed a pair of eyes looking at her. They were a bright red colour, similar to the cereal. She became perplexed. Was the house really haunted, or was it just a spooky brand of cereal? She was curious as to how many people ate this unusual food. It wasn't a well-known brand, as she hadn't seen any advertisements for it on television.She hadn't had an appetite for anything else since she started eating it. Her husband mocked her about eating like a pregnant woman and suggested she buy a pregnancy kit, but she was on the pill and couldn't be pregnant. Is that all there was to it? Was she expecting? Did pregnant women have hallucinations? She wished she could see her husband. She was all alone in this insane home, and no one could rescue her. If only she could reach for her phone and call her husband.She regained her voice at that point. She let out a piercing scream and took off running. She left her room and into her husband's study, but the eyes followed her. They were making fun of her and observing her. She ran from room to room, but the presence surrounded her. She burst into tears. She had never expected to witness such an unusual occurrence in her life. It was the dreaded cereal. She tried her luck and dashed into one of the restrooms, quickly closing the door behind her. She was by herself. She exhaled a massive sigh of relief as she tightened the window shut. She collapsed on the floor, her hands on her head. She was suffering from a dull ache in her brain. Her heart was pounding with fear.After a few moments, the colour of the room shifted. It had tracked her down. She looked out the window and saw cereal flakes falling on her hair. It looked like snow. The intensity grew until they started to penetrate into her body through her skin. They were all over the place. A strong gust of wind swept her out of the toilet through the broken glass.She knew she was going to die at this point. The cursed house, cursed window, and cursed cereal all conspired to kill her. Dave, her loving husband, will be devastated. He'd come home to an empty house, with no idea where his wife was. He was in love with her so much that he wouldn't rest until he found her.He'd wail like a child and call the cops. Emily wished it was just a nightmare or a prank. The wind continued to haul her to an unknown place. She came across Mr Jaxon, an elderly and odd man who lived alone and made a living by mowing lawns. He was standing outside, hands akimbo, staring up at the sky. He'd seen her, hadn't he? Could he assist her? Would he be capable of rescuing her?",

          "context": "She dragged a stone and sat on it trying to peer through the slit. Oh, the stone was not tall enough. She wasn't able to see outside clearly when she sat on it. She looked around and ran to pick up a dry leaf that had fallen into the log. She laid the leaf on the log floor and folded it several times and pressed it down with both her tiny arms to lessen the bumpiness. She kept the bundle of folded-dry-leaf on top of the stone. The leaf crackled as she adjusted herself on top of it. Now the seat had the right height, and she could keep watching outside as much as she wanted.Morana was her name. She lived in a mushroom growing inside a decaying log. She won't go out of the log during the day; when the sunlight filled the forest. She only came out at night; in the realm of darkness. For, she was a malevolent dwarf that caused death and decay by simply being present.It was early morning and Morana was ready to do what she usually did, almost every day. The forest was slowly coming alive. The silence was quickly broken by the chirping of birds. The air filled up with the scent of blooming flowers and soon came out the benevolent dwarfs that made flowers bloom and plantlets grow from their mere touch.Morana kept looking at them as long as she could. She was always mesmerized by their beautiful clothes made of colorful flower petals. She sometimes imagined herself in one of them; a beautiful gown made of sunflower petals, running and dancing with other benevolent dwarfs. A smile would always draw across her chubby face making her cheeks turn red at such thoughts. Once she even tried to make a nice flower-petal dress for herself; she secretly went near a freshly bloomed, beautiful daisy flower. She climbed onto a stone nearby, and with trembling hands touched its petals. To her dismay, the flower soon wilted and dried up.She looked at the benevolent dwarfs and thought how beautiful they were with pink smiling faces and green eyes. She wanted to become their friend. When she slept, she would always dream of playing with them. In her dreams at least, they adored her, despite her pale skin and jet-black eyes that turned red whenever her dark magic worked.She didn't spell flowers, leaves, or plantlets to wilt and die intentionally; she only had to come in contact with them, and the magic would happen on its own.Although Morana was aware of all the names of the benevolent dwarfs in her neighborhood, none of them even knew of Morana's presence in the old decaying log.The other dwarfs were playing with a ball made of pollen, which accidentally got thrown onto the log where Morana lived and fell through a hole into it, only a few feet away from Morana. The dwarfs started looking for the lost ball everywhere.Morana took a glance at the disappointed dwarfs who weren't able to spot their ball and with trembling hands, she walked towards the ball. She kept looking at it for several long seconds, closed her eyes, and let out a deep sigh. She tried to keep her powers under control and picked up the ball from both her hands. Taking a small peek at the ball through a half-open eye; she saw that the ball was still golden and not turned brown under her power. She slowly opened her eyes and with determination quickly came out of her hiding place.The other dwarfs didn't notice her silent approach at first. She walked silently towards Rosemerelda who was the closest to her. Holding the ball in front of her, Morana whispered Rosemerelda's name, who turned with a startle hearing a deep whispering voice.Rosemerelda had never seen a dwarf, like the one who was standing close to her; with a pale face, black untidy hair, and black eyes. She was wearing a dress made out of a dry leaf, with stains of berries. Actually, Morana had tried to add some color to her dress by trying to paint on it with the juice of berries.Rosemerelda remembered the dark stories about malevolent dwarfs that her mother used to tell her, warning her not to wander too deep into the forest. Malevolent dwarfs were cruel and cunning. They hated light and colors. They always tried to steal away happiness.Before Rosemerelda could react, her friends had already started to panic. They were shrieking, running away, and calling for help. Rosemerelda was frozen with fear. She couldn't reach for her friends as they had already run far away. She turned and looked again at Morana.Meanwhile, Morana could feel her heart beating fast, and a ringing sound in her ears. She knew she had taken the wrong decision. She should have waited, hiding in her log, pretending not to exist. But now, there was no turning back. She could feel her power taking advantage of her overwhelmed feelings and rising inside her.Rosemerelda watched Morana's eyes turning red, and the golden ball in her hands drying and turning brown. Her shriek wasn't escaping her trembling lips. But then she was dragged away from Morana by Forge; her brother.Forge noticed the strange dwarf when he stopped his search for the ball midway and turned to see why everyone was shrieking. She stood their dark and bold handing over their ball at Rosemerelda who stood there unmoving appearing to be frozen. He wasn't scared by the stranger until her eyes turned red, that's when he thought to grab Rosemerelda and run away to safety where others had already gone.Morana ran away to the log and hid in her mushroom. But the dwarf community was shaken by the story of a malevolent dwarf hiding close to their habitat, who had even attacked their children. Soon the story reached Queen Esmerelda.\"The creature had tried to attack your daughter my queen!\"\"Where is Rosemerelda now?\"\"She's sleeping my queen. The poor child has a fever. I wonder if that disgusting creature spelled her!\"Forge overheard the conversation in his mother's room.\"She didn't attack mother, I thought she was giving us back our ball, but then she destroyed the ball\" he shrugged his shoulders.\"Did you see her Forge?\"\"Yes mother, she was just like us but paler and had black hair and red eyes\"\"Did you see her spelling your sister?\"\"No, Rosemerelda was very scared. She swore she heard her calling her name.\"\"The dark creature had spelled our princess!\" the queen's adviser seemed to hate dwarfs of darkness.Not only him, but the whole kingdom was frightened by the story of a malevolent dwarf spelling their princess. Queen Esmerelda had to order the soldiers to imprison the creature of darkness to restore peace in her kingdom.It took no time for the soldiers to destroy the decaying log and find Morana.Forge was sorry for her when he saw her at the palace being chained and caged. She stood balled up, hiding her face in her knees and lifting it slowly only to see what was going on. Her black eyes were swollen and wet. His heart would tell him, that she was innocent but he had his doubts.That night Forge couldn't sleep. His mind was disturbed by the thought of a lonely dwarf, feeling scared and cold in the palace dungeon. He decided to check on her and find out her true intentions.Down to the dungeons he went in stealth, hiding in the shadows and escaping the eagle eyes of guards. He kept watching Morana hiding away in the darkness to see what she was up to. Hours ticked by but she did nothing but keep hiding her face. The paintings on her dress were cute. Flowers, birds, and smiling dwarfs. He wondered why she wouldn't draw all the bad symbols of death and darkness.Then she stood up, dried away her tears with her hands, and came closer to the prison bars to talk to the guard.\"Please let me go! I didn't mean to hurt anyone.\"\"Get back you dark creature, don't think that I would fall for your nasty tricks,\" the guard would shout.Forge understood that he was scaring her even more, her lips began to tremble and her hands began to shake. She held onto the prison bars. But soon, her eyes turned all red and the bars began to melt. He was scared by her power and so was the guard, who called others in alarm. But very clearly he remembered seeing Morana's eyes wide with fear as she looked at her own hands.The next morning came the news that the creature of darkness has destroyed a prison cell and also attacked several guards.Meanwhile, away from the kingdom of benevolent dwarfs stood the kingdom of malevolent dwarfs where the forest was always dark and shadowy and filled with marshes. Where the only life forms available were frogs, rats and owls apart from the dwarfs.The fears of other dwarfs weren't something pointless as the dwarfs of the darkness were nothing like Morana. They were wicked and cruel.From ancient times, the benevolent dwarfs and malevolent dwarfs were in constant wars that never ceased. Day and night the good dwarfs protected the forest and the life in it from the dark powers. Every single day a few brave dwarfs would suffer death, sickness, and disability. But somehow life and death would always balance. Until powerful Remorus became king of the malevolent dwarfs.Remorus showed no mercy; he hated life, laughter, and happiness. The malevolent dwarfs were unstoppable under his blood-thirsty guidance. Many suffered death and the ones alive, lived hidden in barrows underground while darkness overruled the surface.Remorus's rule was breaking the balance between life and death. The forest was slowly turning lifeless. But soon, a young and brave dwarf called Lumina defeated Remoras.Remorus was clever, never giving up, and furious but Lumina was gifted. She was the eldest daughter of King Arthur, sister of Esmerelda. No dwarf ever had seen such powerful magic. Remorus was not powerful as Lumina. The dark armies suffered severe damage and had to retreat. But Remorus shot a poison arrow right through Lumina's heart.Before she died, Lumina had spelled her power into her ring and gave it to Esmerelda who was by her side when she died. Esmerelda having a brave heart just like her sister ruled the kingdom after King Arthur using the power of the ring to protect her kingdom. King Remorus was still out there, looking for his chance to return.King Remorus walked up and down, his dark cape floating behind him. His brows knotted together and his nostrils flared. Anger boiling in his eyes.\"Keeping one of our children as a prisoner!\" he roared. \"How dare she?\" The news about Morana had by now reached the Dark palace.King Remorus hadn't only been waiting all this time, but he was preparing for the next attack.\"It's time to break the silence again.\"Dark had fallen in the kingdom of light. Prince Forge and Princess Rosemerelda were on a mission, moving in the shadows of the dungeon. The guards in the dungeon were fewer that night as most of them were summoned to the army with the news of the malevolent army approaching their kingdom.Forge distracted the guard near Morana's cell by making the guard follow him while Rosemerelda opened up the prison and unlocked all the chains imprisoning Morana. Morana looked astonished. Rosemerelda looked at Morana's face all wet with tears and her bruised ankles and wrists.\"We are so sorry,\" she whispered.Morana was too surprised to speak. Happy tears welled in her eyes. At least one person liked her.\"How did you know my name?\"\"I was always there in the log, watching you play. I meant no harm.\"\"Why didn't you come out?\"\"I knew no one would like me.\"Rosemerelda touched Moranas hand and smiled at her.\"Where is your family?\"Morana remembered being carried on her father's shoulders, her mother beside them talking to her and laughing. She was so small. They played all around the forest at night. She remembered her mother touching a leaf and her eyes glowing red. She was awed by her mother's beauty. She then showed the bright red leaf in her arm at Morana.\"Death is a part of life just like birth. It's sad, brings grief but death is essential for the life cycle to be active.\"Unlike Morana, her mother had good control over her powers. She made leaves dry up into different colors; red, yellow, brown, purple. Her dress was made of dry leaves of different hues and her hair adorned with a crown of multi-colored, dried flowers.She remembered hearing shouts and booms nearby, her mother took her off her father's shoulders and ran away into the forest. She kept calling for her father all the way, but her mother hushed her and cradled her. They were being chased. An enchanted thorny vine encircled them, although her mother spelled it, the thorns had already poisoned her. her mother instructed her to run away and hide until her father found her.\"Life is not forever Morana, enjoy it while it lasts. Although our powers are dark, remember that light is unworthy without darkness.\"She ran as far as she could as her mother instructed her. She waited for her father, but he never came. She was hungry. She saw a dwarf mother giving round juicy berries for her child. She slowly came out of her hiding place and slowly walked towards them. Their eyes were wide with fear when they saw a creature of darkness coming out of her hiding place but maybe as she was small they handed her a berry. But when she took it to her hand, the berry just withered and died making her eyes turn all red. The rest of the memory was not pleasant.It was the last time she went near other dwarfs. She never found others like her. She thought that they were extinct as she didn't know that they were driven away to a faraway place in the forest. She was not ever able to control her powers completely although she learned to eat berries without spoiling them and forever in hiding she lived wishing, she was like others.\"They died.\"\"Come with us. We'll help you escape.\"Forge had now joined them. They guided Morana out of the palace and into the forest.Morana was running as fast as she could, away from others. When she heard shouts and booms. She climbed onto a tree, higher and higher until she saw what was going on.She could see two armies fighting. She couldn't believe her eyes! There were more like her! Life and death were fighting against each other, light and darkness trying to overpower one another. Precious lives being lost on both sides. Children would become orphans like her. She could recognize Queen Esmerelda on the war front. What if she .,what would happen to Rosemerelda and Forge?Rage, disappointment, sadness, grief began to overwhelm Morana but mixed with them was compassion and forgiveness. Her power had seized her. She rose into the air more like a fairy than a dwarf. And like a lightning bolt, she landed on the war ground, separating the two armies with a powerful wind.No one had witnessed such power after Princess Lumina who had the power to control the wind, water, and fire, in addition to the normal power of benevolent dwarfs. But most of all, they were surprised to see that this power was now owned by a malevolent dwarf.\"Life and death both are parts of one cycle. It's foolish how you act as if you don't see that. Why can't you see the similarities between us hidden among our differences?\"King Remorus looked at the little girl wearing a dress made of dried leaves. He looked at her pointed nose, wide mouth, and big black eyes which were turned all red with power. Tears began to prick his eyes, and his heart throbbed to hug her tight.The memory of his wife dying in his arms and telling him to protect their daughter; kept darkening his mind, suffocating his heart and numbing all his senses turning him into a monster. He had been destroying everything, avenging his wife and searching for his lost daughter. Finally, he found her, how much had he missed her. His daughter.\"Morana!\"Morana identified his voice. All this time she thought he was dead. Her dark eyes turned golden as she ran into his arms. Plantlets and flower buds sprang from where her foot touched the ground.Everyone wondered why nature gifted Morana; the daughter of the dark king Remorus, with such powers.The war between the two kingdoms stopped. All the dwarfs learned to live peacefully, respecting each other's powers and using their own wisely.Morana was always the strange one among her friends, but she didn't wish that she wasn't different than others. She learned that one can be different but still fit in. She knew that whether our powers are dark or not, we can always choose whom we want to be. In the end, our perceptions and actions would define who we are.",

          "context": "Once upon there was a huge, huge cat with huge huge claws. Can you picture him? Scary looking isnt he? At least thats what the people around him thought of him. His purring sounded to them like an earthquake and his miaows like a roar that could make their organs shake in their bodies. No wonder people stayed as far away from this huge monster-like-looking creature as possible. Some big cats would be happy to be left alone, but not him. This big, big cat was still a tiny little kitten inside with tiny little kitten needs. He wanted nothing more than to be hugged, to be petted, and to lay his big head on a friendly humans lap. None of those things are easy to achieve when everyone runs away from you as far as they can, so one day the big, big cat with the tiny, tiny heart decided to go into the world to find people that were brave enough to love him. He searched the forests and fields, the deserts and beaches, he looked through windows and at some point even dragged his clumsy body up a lamppost to have a better view. No matter where his journey brought him, he never lost sight of his tiny hearts longing. The human voices never seemed far away, yet always out of reach. If only they could hear the beating of his tiny heart instead of just the loudness of his roars... Because the big, big cat with the tiny heart knew how scary he was to people, he also understood that just running up to them was not the solution if he wanted the people to feel safe around him. Thats why he decided to be very mindful by approaching any new group by waving at them from a distance. A great idea if you are anything but a huge, scary-looking cat. However, in his case, the people generously misperceived his kind intentions. What they saw was not a friendly waving cat, but a threatening-looking beast shaking its claws at them, threatening to tear them apart. As one might expect, they freaked out and did what humans always do when they feel irrationally frightened, they took out their guns and started shooting at this poor creature. This sweet, naive cat saw the people running after him while shooting their guns and thought:Wow, theyve finally come to me and they want to play!And so he started to run and jump around, he started to sneak up on them to give them playful yaps with his paws. As with everything in life, its all fun and games until somebody gets shot, and that was exactly what happened to the cat. He felt a sudden sting in his paw and got really scared. As fast as he could, he ran into the forest until he could find a place in the bushes to hide. Where before he did anything in his power to get closer to people, he now wanted nothing more than to get as far away from them as possible. Right at that moment, a girl was walking through the forest. She saw the bushes moving wildly by the heavy breathing of the cat. As she came closer to him and he spotted her, he used his growl to scare her away, since now the big, big cat with the tiny kitten inside had gotten afraid of people. He didnt see them as friends anymore but rather as dangerous creatures that were all out to hurt him. He growled and growled but the little girl didnt move an inch. She was not scared of him, oh no Why would she? Her father and mother were very mean to her every day. They were always shouting at her and occasionally they would hit her. What could this hairy creature possibly do to her that they hadnt done to her already? And so she came closer. When she had finally reached him, she saw this poor, trembling creature looking up at her with big eyes. The whole frightening-looking facade that people had been so afraid of was now reduced to nothing more than a ball of fear and fluff.Dont be afraid little kitty, Im here to help you, she said while petting his big head. She took his paw and looked at the big wound.That doesnt look good at all, little kitty. It seems like I will have to take you home to take care of this.When the big cat heard those words, his eyes widened with excitement. Would he finally be able to have human friends? To spend time with them and play with them? The excitement about this prospect gave him new energy and he followed the girl home, hopping playfully alongside her while occasionally rubbing his big head against her leg. As they neared the house of the little girl, her mother and father were sitting outside, waiting for the little girl with pure rage in their eyes. She started to worry. What if they would yell at her for bringing this gentle creature into their home? What if they would hurt her... or him? At that moment the big cat with the tiny kitten inside noticed the parents and he immediately got excited. Even more people to cuddle and share his home with! With great enthusiasm, he lifted his paw and started to wave wildly. So wild that the parents' eyes widened. All they knew in life was aggression and so they took the kindness of the cat for raging anger. Immediately they ran away as far as they could. From that day on the cat and the little girl lived together in the house where there was always a sweet harmony. She didnt have to worry ever again about someone yelling at her or beating her. And him? He could get all the cuddles he wanted and forever put his big paws around someone who would never ever be scared of him.",

          "context": "Nine-year-old Marlene hated cockroaches more than anything else. She could not bear the sight of them and would immediately scream for help. Daaaaaaddy! Another one! she would say, with tears running down her tanned cheeks. Daddy would always get them and then carry little Marlene to the bed. He was tall and had black curly hair and small eyes that almost completely transformed into one big wrinkle when he smiled, which was often. They are harmless, Marlene, he would say, but no matter how many times she heard those words, they never sank in. All she could see was a crunchy, hairy and pointy little being which was much faster than her, and which appeared to know her every thought and smell her fear. Marlene and her father lived in a house of two rooms in a hot, coastal rural town. They lived close to a small river where he fished from time to time, so Marlenes house often smelled like a swamp or like fish. The walls, which used to be white, were now of a light grey color and decorated by Marlenes drawings of odd-looking fruits with eyes, legs and arms. Wake up, Marlene were Marlenes least favorite words. They meant that it was time to get ready to go to school. Marlene would rather stay home and go explore the trees that lead to the stream. One of the trees, which had a cavity near the bottom in which Marlene sometimes stuffed pebbles and little dolls, was her favorite. She loved visiting it. Wake up, Marlene, she heard her fathers words again and opened her eyes suddenly, hit by the fear that they would arrive late to school again and her father would get in trouble. Daddy was a math, science and music teacher at the local school, which was about 15 minutes away (walking distance) and consisted of two small buildings that were still unpainted, a small playground with a discolored red slide and a swing made out of rope and wood, and two basketball rims with strings attached to them that revealed they once had nets. Sometimes, Marlenes father had to stay in school longer, so he instructed her to walk home and start her homework. To Marlene, these walks back home were a secret adventure that she sometimes shared with Janet, her closest friend. They balanced their bodies on the edge of the unpaved road, trying to avoid, at the same time, the few cars that drove on it and the bushes to its side. My father said that there were snakes in the bushes, said Marlene, with suspense in her voice and a glimmer in her eyes. I saw a big one the other day, replied Janet. Lets run home. One, two, threego. * Of all her memories, only the most remote and simple ones remain. In particular, the ones from childhood, but not all of them. Marlene, now ninety-four, has forgotten all about the day in which her father was killed. The memories that she built after that, with hard work, love and dedication, are now vague and inconsistent. Sometimes, when some of her thirteen grandchildren visit her, she does not really recognize them or confuses them with people that she used to know. She calls Mile, her youngest grandchild, Janet. She does resemble Janet a lot, but no one knows that, as only Marlenes father had gotten to know her childhood friend. Seven days before Marlene turned eleven, Janets family was forced by dangerous, bad people terrorizing her small rural town to pack their things and leave. Janet! Janet! Dont leave! I have an idea. Tell your mom that you will stay with me and daddy and live with us for a year, Marlenes words are slow and can hardly be understood by ten-year-old Mile, who nods following the instructions of her father, standing opposite to her, on the other side of Marlene, who now sits on a wheelchair. * At the home, there are no pets allowed, but Marlenes nurse, Gilbert, decided to make an exception that no one must know of. He is forty-three and studied to become a nurse at thirty-six after failing to launch his career as a writer, to which he dedicated most of his life. Daddy, daddy, dont kill it! cried Marlene that day in her shaky voice, with her eyes almost completely filled with tears. Gilbert, who had once had a spider as a pet, was not afraid of cockroaches, so he had successfully trapped it in a plastic cup after several attempts. This cockroach was huge. To Marlene, it almost resembled a human being, which is why, despite the strong fear of cockroaches that she developed in childhood, she did not want this one to die. It was still crunchy and hairy, but its huge antennae and rounder body somehow made it more amiable. Gilbert could not find the words to explain to Marlene that she could not have the cockroach stay in her room too long, so he just found a bigger plastic container, punched several tiny holes to it, and put the cockroach in it. Gilbert was short and a little bit chubby, but his arms and hands were quick. He had been in several bands, playing the guitar and the drums, but always ended up hating all the music he helped create. For the sixteen days in which Marlene had a cockroach as a pet, Gilbert placed it under the bed every time someone visited her, covering it with a small towel in front of her so that she knew that nothing would happen to it. Wake up, Marlene, she heard at dawn. Then she looked at the plastic container next to her bed and smiled. They are harmless, she said to herself, before going back to a particular day in her childhood in which her daddy brought her a new doll back from school. One of the parents gave me this doll for you, he said with his deep, caring voice, you can put it in the tree if you want, but dont lose it. Marlene looked around her. The room was all white, not light grey, and it smelled like lavender and alcohol, not like a swamp or fish. She felt lost and very afraid. She looked down at bony hands and did not recognize them. She did not recognize that body. She did not recognize the yellow pajama which that body was wearing. She was speechless. She looked to the floor and saw a plastic container. Inside of it, there was a cockroach. Daaaaaddy! Another one! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Gilbert rushed through her door and saw her there, sitting on her chair, trembling. In her eyes, he saw panic and fear like he had never seen before. It was as though her eyes were seeing something terrible, something that could not be spoken. Gilbert felt guilty about letting her keep the cockroach. Hit by panic and without really thinking about it, he opened the box and squeezed it to death with a small book that he carried in his pocket. Marlene started calming down and mumbling: Arent you going to carry me to bed, daddy? Gilbert, who was disinfecting his book with the alcohol that he kept on one of the little tables in Marlenes room, turned around to see her mumbling and gently closing her eyes at the same time.",

          "context": "Stacy lined the tree with shiny crystal teardrops she took from the back of her grandmothers lamp.She was hoping she wouldn't miss them.Her garden was almost complete.She had houses where they could live, swings, and teeter-totters for them to play.Stacy had been building her fairy garden for over a year.Her collection started with her grandmother buying her the first house.Not long afterward, everyone brought her accessories to go with her village. The family realized that the trinkets kept the little girl entertained and helped with her loneliness.She was an only child who lived in the country, and her neighbors were few.Stacy went inside to ask her mother if she could have a picnic under the tree in her fairy garden.Her mother assured her it would be fine.Stacy asks for milk, honey, and some whipped cream.Her mother told her that it was a strange lunch and asked her if she wouldn't prefer a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Stacy accepted the sandwich but asked if her mother could provide the other food also.Stacy's mother told her she would give her a glass of milk, but the honey and whipped cream would have to come another time.Stacy was disappointed but decided to lure a fairy to her garden with only milk and the shiny teardrops she had placed.She climbed up in the tree with her sandwich and waited to see if any fairy took the bait.Stacy sat quietly and ate her lunch.She soon realized she needed the milk with the sticky sandwich. After twenty minutes, the five-year-old climbed down the tree and took a large drink of milk to free her gums of the peanut butter.The fairies were not going to come today and she went inside.Stacy went to her room and picked up the fairy book she had borrowed from the library.Tomorrow she would have to find a way to get her mother to give her some honey and whipped cream.That is what fairies like to eat.Stacy had already convinced her mother to let her plant flowers around her garden.The sweet smell of foxglove was one of the flowers the fairies liked.The fairies would make a home in the bell of the flower and gather their pixie dust. Pixie dust was one of the magical powers the fairies possessed, and they also had control over some of the elements, wind, fire, and water.Stacy made sure when she was asking the fairy to come that she only asked for good fairies.She read in her book that there were also evil fairies.Stacy didn't want any of them living in her garden.The fairy she was seeking would be a friend, a playmate, and someone she would love.Stacy read all of the folklore in her book that was more advanced for her five years. She was determined to attract a fairy.The morning came, and Stacy got up early to return to her garden.She caught her mother distracted and on the phone with her grandmother. Stacy opened the jar of honey and put some in a plastic bag along with the whipped cream.Her mother came to the kitchen and asked her what she would like for breakfast, and she chose cereal. She needed the milk to complete her fairy trap.With the baggie stuck firmly in her pocket, Stacy went outside to her village.The wind was blowing a warm breeze that felt good on her face when she entered.Stacy found one of the teardrops lying on the ground and thought the wind must have blown it down. The crystal was lying beside a small trinket that looked like a green glass rock.She wondered if the fairies had visited after she went inside.Stacy was excited to tell her mother.She ran inside and found that she was still on the phone with her grandmother.Her mother told her it was pretty and maybe her cat had drug it in.Stacy knew it was from the fairies, and she needed to figure out a way to make contact.The book also mentioned the fairies liked beautiful music.Stacy looked through the house for the radio and had to settle for her cassette player that played children's nursery rhymes.She was outside in her garden for several hours while waiting for the fairies to visit until her mother called her in for dinner.Stacy would have to start fresh in the morning. After dinner, she would study her book again to see if there was anything she was missing.Stacy's mom and dad talked to her at dinner and asked her if she had an exciting day.She told them about the trinket the fairy left and that she was getting close to making them appear.Her father smiled and told her he loved her imagination.Stacy's mom tucked her in bed and kissed her goodnight.As soon as the light went off and her mother left the room, Stacy turned on her flashlight and started reading her book.She had hung shiny things and gave them milk, cream, and honey. Stacy played music and planted beautiful foxglove flowers that smelled heavenly.She was kind and generous to all animals and loved her cat.She didn't know what was missing.At eight, Stacy woke up.After breakfast, she slipped out more cream, milk, and honey.Stacy gathered up her cassette player to take with her.Her mother told her it was supposed to be a hot day and to make sure she drank plenty of water.Stacy continued walking fast while not paying attention to what her mother said. She was excited to see if the fairies had visited and left her another trinket.Stacy looked everywhere in her village for anything out of place without success.She was sure that the fairies had been there before, and it wasn't her cat, Sebastian, that had brought her the green rock.Stacy was disappointed and started to doubt the existence of fairies when her mother called to her.\"Stacy, she said, \" it is very hot, and if you want to continue to play outside, you must drink this bottle of water.Stacy grudgingly went to the house and took the water.She was busy and didn't want to be disturbed.Sebastian jumped into her fairy garden after her return and knocked over the houses. She was upset until she noticed him pawing at her bottle of water.He was thirsty too.Stacy took her fairy garden pond and poured Sebastian some water.The crystals above her head in the trees started to jingle and sparkle the colors of the prism. A warm breeze blew as the fairies came into the garden.Stacy had accomplished her wish to become friends with the fairies by offering them gifts and showing her compassion for animals when she put her cat, Sabastian's, needs above her own.",

          "context": "Hey Maxie, come on. Its getting late, Mrs. Markle said.Mom, I dont want to be on time. I dont want to be there at all.Now Maxie, we asked you before signing up for the workshop.Yeah, but you didnt tell me that it was residential. Plus people go to the same residential programme year after year. Nobody will let me into their gang, I will be a bigger joke than ever, wailed Maxie.Little pixies can be nice, just give them a chance. Besides all pixies have pointed ears.Maybe during your time. All the other pixies are going to make fun of me. And my ears are not just pointed, they are huge. They are so huge, that you could see them from the other side of the city. I cant hide my ears when I sleep.Dont be silly. You dont have to hide your ears Maxie, you look pretty. You are a cute little boy with cute little ears.Well, you are wrong about the little ears part.Well, I find them cute and so will the people who matter to you. Dont mind the haters, they will always exist. Now get in the car. Your father already loaded your suitcases.Maxie wailed along the way but obeyed and got in the car. He sat in the backseat, cross with himself and everybody else.He had big ears and he knew it, bigger than most pixies his age. They stuck out like daggers, daggers he hid under his cap during the day. But he could not sleep with his cap on. They hurt his neck. He had to remove them. And then, all the other pixies would see his giant ears sticking out and make fun of him. He felt tears form in his eyes. He wiped them off vigorously. If there was one thing he was not going to do, it was weep like a baby. He looked out the window.Now, Maxie, you will be a good boy, wont you. We dont want to hear about any fights or such okay, said his mom.If the other pixies are nice, said Maxie.Is this about the ear again. Maxie, you look good. It is only you who thinks that your ears arent cute, said his dad.No, dad. So do the twenty odd students from summer camp last year. All of them thought that my ears were the size of an elf.You still have to be good because we wont be driving mid-camp to pick you up, said his dad.But, started Maxie, but was cut off.He was crosser than ever.They reached the gates and Mr. Markle parked. They got down and Maxie dragged his large suitcase over to the front desk. His parents walked with him to the front desk.Maxie Markle, Maxie said.The busy lady in the front desk looked through the record in the log book and passed over a notebook for his parents to sign. They dutifully signed, kissed Maxie and walked back towards the car.Good boy, they mouthed as the car moved away.Pixies started to stand in groups and talk and catch up with each other. Nobody took any notice of Maxie, they all had their own gangs, the kind of thing that Maxie was afraid of.Maxie chose a corner in the waiting room and sat inconspicuously, waiting for the lady to complete the signings and sending off of parents before she got down to allotting rooms.Another pixie, clad in a beautiful purple dress walked over to him.Hi, I am Linda, she said sitting next to Maxie.Hi, I am Maxie, he said scooting over.This is my first time in this camp. Have you been here before? she asked with big beautiful eyes.Um, no. This is my first time here too. But I have been to other camps before, he said.Thats nice. I am a little scared.Well, dont be. As long as you fit in, there is going to be no problem. You seem young, so there will be many your age who are here for the first time as well, he said with a small sigh.Lets hope I fit in then, she said, with an invisible sigh as well.The lady started to call out rooms. Girls first. Lindas name was called.Bye, hope to see you soon again, Linda said dragging her suitcase along.Bye, waved Maxie.Soon, Maxie was allotted to a room as well.He walked into the room allotted to him. There were three other pixies already in the room. They stood near one of the beds and spoke, laughing loudly on occasions. Again, nobody took any notice of Maxie.He didnt bother either. Two stupid weeks and he would be out of there. He had many friends back home. He could always go back to talking to them, once he was home.He was lost in his own thoughts and he suddenly bumped into another pixie.Hey, watch where you are going freshy, he said.Sorry, said Maxie and quickly collected his thoughts. He walked over to the bed with his name tag on it and put his suitcase down.He just sat there. He wanted to talk to some of the other pixies, but he was afraid.Finally, when he saw the gang of five turn to just two, he walked over to them and tried to introduce himself.Hi, I am Maxie, he said.Well, everybodys got a name dont they, said one of them.Dont be rude Ash. Hi, I am Rocky, said the other one.Hi, Maxie smiled not knowing what to do next. This was all one big mistake.There was an awkward silence, and then Rocky broke it.Oh, we were just going to go around and look at what we missed over term. Do you want to join us? asked Rocky.Maxie could see the rest of the gang glare at him from the door. He didnt want to put Rocky in any trouble, so he said, No, I need to unpack first.Okay, join us if you get done soon, said Rocky, trotting over to join the rest of the gang.Maxie went back to his bed and sat there wondering if Linda was able to make friends.He sat there until the dinner bell was rung. He slowly got off bed and walked over to the dining hall. He didnt know where to sit. He found an empty table by the end of the room and sat there as other people with nowhere to go, filed in next to him. They all ate in silence. Maxie went back to his room slowly. He dreaded removing his cap. He desperately didnt want to. But he would look equally silly sleeping with a cap on.He waited for the others to go to bed. He undressed and sat on the bed pretending to look at a cartoon in a magazine that he had brought with him. He had his cap on though it didnt match his night dress. The others filed into bed one by one. He waited for the warden to switch off the light before he removed his cap.The warden came along finally and saw Maxie sitting on his bed.Maxie, you have to lie down for me to switch off the lights, she said.Maxie glared at her and lowered himself.Maxie, you forgot to remove your cap, you silly little boy, she admonished.He saw that all eyes were now on him. He took his hands to the cap slowly and removed the cap. His giant ears stuck out and a ringing laughter went through the room. Maxie turned red in the face and pulled the blanket over his face. He could no longer control himself, he cried soundlessly.Once he was out of breath, he saw that all the others were sound asleep, and why wouldnt they be, they werent hurt. He got out of bed and walked to the door.He didnt want to be on the room anymore, it suffocated him. He noiselessly left the dorm and walked to the pond. He walked slowly to the pond and found a shadow there. He moved away swiftly before the pixie noticed him. He didnt want to get caught and his parents to be called.He heard sobbing noises. He didnt know who it was but the person could not be a counsellor. The sound belonged to somebody much younger.He walked over to the bench and peeped. He found Linda sitting there, sobbing into her hand-kerchief.Linda!Linda sat up with a start, then relaxed a little after seeing that it was Maxie.What are you doing here, sobbing late into the night? he asked.What are you doing here? she asked drying her eyes.They looked at each other.Okay, fine. Everybody laughed at me, so I came here, she said finally.What, why? he asked.You wont laugh? she asked.Of course, I wont he said.She removed the cap of her head and her ears were just as big as Maxies.She looked at him. He just silently removed his cap too. She was shocked for a second, then smiled.Now I know why you are here. You want to hang out?Yes, I do.",

          "context": "I never really understood, why people lived so complicated lives. Why there were so many things going on in their little heads with billions of thoughts. So many options, so much freedom, still they complained about it with jealousy in their eyes and need to be someone else in their voices every time they spoke.\tThey would come to the park every day, or just every Friday, doing the same thing all over again. Sometimes I wondered, why they desperately wanted to be someone else all the time. Or why they talked bad about those, who were so different from them.\tMy whole life, I was studying them, trying to find out, what was going on. When one day, all of a sudden, just after the big shiny Moon on the night sky went away and an even bigger bright Sun showed me, that there was just green around me.\tNot little violet flower like me. Just grass.\tAn hour went by and the park filled with people again, just as usual. But today, their faces werent so happy anymore, nor their eyes glittering while looking my way. Only this little girl stopped, the only person, that was not bored, and pointed her index finger at me.\tA tiny smile appeared on her baby face.\tLook mum, thats such a beautiful flower, she shouted, running towards me. In a second, an older woman stood next to her, nodding. Youre right, Melanie. And she leaned to me, picking me up.\tThe small wave of pain rushed through my body, and I felt the blood draining from the edge of my stem, making me cold.\tMum put me into the hands of her daughter, Melanie, and her big blue eyes admired me for a little. So pretty. Can I keep it? she questioned her mum, and after she nodded, she chucked beautifully, which made my leaves flutter lightly. I was happy for making her happy.\tAll three of us walked out of the park and out of nowhere, the air began to be havier and the Sun wasnt warming me anymore. I felt cold and scared. But that feeling quickly went away, after Melanie came up to other little creatures as her, showing me off.\tLook at this pretty flower, she told kids around her proudly and in response, she received a wave of brightened faces. I must have blushed for being idolized like this. Most of the time, it was my violet friend.\tWhere did you find it? some boy asked Melanie, who kissed me softly. I saw that hint of jealousy in his eyes, but it complimented me. They praised me.\tMelanie smiled, showing her uneven teeth. In the park. But there isnt any other like this one anymore. This is the last one. Kids frowned and began to back off, returning to their game.\tMelanie sobbed. Hey! Where are you going? she asked furiously. I was wondering the same thing. What about me? They barely looked at me for a minute.\tOne of the guys turned to her. Its boring. Max has a car and he promised, we can drive it. He explained and his words hit me painfully. But not Melanie, she smiled, throwing me away, and ran after the other kids.\tI fell down to the cold ground, not soft that I used to spend every day, but hard and not comfortable. And I realized that Melanie was just the same.\tFor the rest of my life, I laid on the road, trying not to cry after someone stepped on me, thinking about Melanie. Thinking about everyone.\tI knew, that by the time, the Moon would appear in the sky, I would bleed out or dry. So I just cherished the last moment of it. Of my existence.\tIt was sad, how people looked at beautiful things with such admiration, but still, it hurt to see them get over it so quickly, after something different, bigger, and more amazing showed up.\tHow jealous they were and how much they fished to be the most popular, the most idolized ones, still, they acted all the same. And how could they adore someone the same as all of them? Just by what they had. And what the others didnt. By what they made them cooler than them.\tIt wasnt about personality. About what you liked and who you were. They just praised what the others praised. They wanted to be so popular and in reality, all they did, was lost themselves.\tBut, was it worthy?\tMy whole life, I was a flower. I lived my small life looking at them, studying them. And then, there was grass, all around me, still, everyone stopped, and just saw me. Not because I was cool. Not because I was the most beautiful flower. Not because I was flawless.\tJust cuz of me.\tAnd now, when I wasnt there. There was just grass. Boring grass, without the ability to make people smile.\tSo I laid there, just waiting for my end when suddenly someone picked me up and smiled. It was a person. Their face was not that perfect as Melanies was, and they had shaved head.\tHey, beautiful, they whispered and by a soft voice I could tell, it was a girl. Maybe.\tA warm feeling filled me and I let the person took me with them. After few minutes, they put me into a glass in their apartment and when I looked around, I saw some other flower in the glass with me.\tIt was my violet friend.\tIm Lizzy, she introduced herself to us. Her smile was wide and her lips were much redder than usual lips. And then I remembered. I had seen her before. She would come to the park every evening, just looking around and draw something in her little notebook.\tShe walked over to us with a paper and showed us her painting. It was me and violet.\tI dont understand, who could teared you off. But dont worry, I wont let you die, she told us and I knew, she was one of us. She was the flower.\tA person so unique and herself, then everyone looked at her no matter where she was. She was so original and herself, that instead of picking flowers, she would paint them and capture them forever.\tBecause true beauty wasnt the one, that lasted for a day, for a month or a year. It lasted forever. Therefore, there was nothing greater than true beauty.\tNothing greater, than being your true self.",

          "context": "Twinkling stars were playing hide and seek, covered by the moving clouds in the night so meek. It was half past one, thoughts of being lonely had just begun. Beside that window she kept herself stand, wondering for the end would be so grand. She waited for an year to meet the man; the man of her dreams, the man of her life, to the world she proudly tell herself to be his wife. That was the night she was waiting for so long, as the day next had to take her to where she actually belong. It seemed the fast moving hand of the clock got tired, it was stopping as if it had been fired. Just like her life which had been a roller coaster, she so wanted it to slow down and no more being an imposter. It was dark inside the room, the sheets purely white seemed lit by only the light of the moon.Stuck in between the tall buildings, from the 6th floor she could only have the view of the dull backside of the adjacent buildings and peeking through the edges was astreet with a rotary. That was the only thing she could look upon through that screen but no one passing by at that time of the hour. Her eyes were fixed over the light falling down from the street lamp over the paved pathway. Tired of watching the emptiness of the street, she decided to dose off with blinds open and the moonlight finding way from the fins of the blind. As time passed by, staring up over to the cieling with eyes wide open making her difficult to sleep. The thoughts of the next day running through her mind were not letting her mind to rest. She started feeling cold. A shiver made her goosebumps so intense. She pushed the bedcover and put her feet down. Not realizing its the temperature of the aircon she can lower down, 'The night is getting cold', she said.The sound of clock ticking was helping her to keep the pace of her feet one by one through the length of the room. Following the moonlight, she went by the side of the window again. The fixed glass window was secured by wooden blinds with openable shutters to the sides. She leaned herself over the fixed glass and started to watch the street as if she was waiting for someone to stop by. Her eyes were getting heavy but were not willing to shut. Her eyes suddenly noticed a drop of water over the glass pane sliding down and there was another then another but slower than the rythm of the moving hand of the clock.A car stopped along the street but the only sound that was getting into her earswas 'tick tock', the sound of the clock.A tall handsome guy wearing a dark coloured shirt sneaks out of the passenger seat holding a box. His strong built was visible from his fitted shirt. Hair so short, neatly dressed as what she could observe from that distance.Her eyes went curious for him as they seemed to be trying to get to know him. He moved his arm and twisted his wrist.Must be looking at his watch, she said to herself and then looked at the clock but could not as it was dark inside. Not bothering to switch on the light and neither her phone, Must be around 2, she again murmured.His head was moving right and left, looking over the both sides of the street.'Is he looking for someone? Who meets someone at midnight..!'The car lights flashed and started to move till they gone out of sight leaving him behind standing alone under the street lamp.As time was passing by, she assumed by the sound of thousands of tick from the clock, the movements of the blue shirted man were becoming monotonous.Slowly she realised the room to grow darker and a shadow started to cover the light from the moon. She looked above. The feathery clouds moving in front of the moon and anxiously covering its light. The drizzle was getting visible in the light of the street lamp. The man was still standing there now motionless looking over the right side of the street.Her eyes got still as she started to feel for the helpless man waiting for no-one knows but him.'You idiot man, why dont you go? she shouted hesitatedly.but he did not move..'God knows what he is upto..' Saying this she moved aside.Despite of her apathy, she was feeling concerned for the man standing there at this hour in the rain.She poured water in a glass and pulled the chair towards the window and glanced towards the street light.Where has he gone? Has he met the one he was waiting for? She curiously started to stare here and there till the extent her eyes could lead her. It started to rain heavily.Where could he possibly go? The weather is so rough outside. Did he call his car back.Oh I missed it...!! She felt disappointed.There was a very dim light coming from under a tree with expanded foliage.She squinted and noticed that the light moved.She forced herself againt the window pane to move herself as closer to look clearly out of it.The light went off and on again and again.'What is that?' She asked herself.The light went on and moved, then went off.This continued for around 9-10 times. She tried to look outside from every angle through the window to have a clearer view.Sleep was like evaded from her eyes. She was more concerned of the outside world activity going on, forgetting that she had to look nice for the next day meeting with her man after almost an year.She suddenly got stunned when she felt a cool breeze touched her face, wondering where it came from when the window is having a fixed glass.She heard someone say \"Why can't you come to me when I am so close to you. I know you are awake.\"Taken aback she was.She got terrified and tumbled over her feet held the chair which was there beside her.What was that I just felt and heard?She was all agog.Perplexed she went to the window again and gazed out through the light coming from the street lamp but it was hazy. Her stomach was churning and heart felt heavy as she eagerly tried to have a look around but couldn't even find the shadow of the man standing there. She was disappointed and stood there as if she was waiting for him to return.The telephone rang with a loud noise. She realised it is already 7:30 in the morning as she slept there on the chair looking out of the window.Ma'm, your taxi has arrived. You need assistance with your luggage?, the voice on the other side of the phone asked.'No'. She answered.She got herself ready in 15 min and there she was standing in the lobby.While moving out of the building, she sighed 'Atlast the quarantine is over' and gave a nasty look to the building. She was cheerful to leave behind everything and waiting for the new life waiting ahead.Suddenly she got a shiver down ger spine when saw something which reminded her of the previous night incident.'Stop'. She ordered the chauffeur.The taxi was crossing through the same rotary visible from the room she was inhabited in. She was looking at the street lamp, the pathway and the tree when her eyes got numb. It was the same box, the box covered in a white and red floral printed material. She desperately wanted to jump off the taxi to fetch the box.More than frightened she was, thinking of the voice that whispered in her ears yesterday. She took a deep breadth.\"Lets go\", she said.She did not look behind whatever it was, who ever the man was she saw through the 8'x5' window yesterday, the mystery stood still.",

          "context": "Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a kind King. The King was wise and good, and all of his subjects loved him. The King, however, was unhappy, because his son, the Prince, was a rotten boy who complained all day long and remained ungrateful for all he had.\tMy son must be taught a lesson if he is to become king after me, the King said to the Fairy Godmother.\tWhat would you wish for me to do, my king? She asked.\tPlease dear Fairy Godmother, with all your wisdom and grace, please help my son. Teach him a lesson so that one day he may rule as wisely as I.\tThis I can do, but beware, my king, this lesson will come with a price he must pay. She warned.\tHe needs to be taught, dear Fairy Godmother. I have failed him as a father, but if you help him, he will be redeemed.\tVery well, she said, and then disappeared in a poof of dust.\tThe Prince was in his quarters, bored and angry from being in lessons all day. His face was still red from yelling and throwing a tantrum.\tI never get to do what I want. I hate being here, he said to no one in particular. Just then, the Fairy Godmother appeared before him, causing him such fright.\tMy, my, good Fairy, you scared me! How dare you enter my quarters unannounced! He yelled.\tYoung Prince, I have come to make a deal with you. An offer I think you might like. Please excuse my abrupt appearance, but I thought this was an issue of great importance. She said with a smile.\tThe Prince was intrigued and said, You are forgiven Fairy Godmother, now tell me, what is this deal you wish to offer me?\tLet me ask you this dear little Prince, do you love your life here?\tThe prince gave it some thought and then answered,  No. I hate it here. I think everyone knows that. I am in lessons all day that bore me and get scolded when I climb a tree or play with the gardeners boy. Im always being told what to do and how I have to do the right thing. I wish I wasnt a prince!\tVery well. Just as I suspected. My dear little Prince, if you give up something of value, I am willing to give you a different life in exchange. So, what shall you give up?\tThe prince looked around his quarters, and saw all his fine things; the toys and books he cared nothing for. His eyes fell to the painting of his family, his fathers crown catching his eye. A prince, I want to give up being a prince!\tVery well, said the Fairy Godmother, and with a quick wave of her wand, the Prince was transported.\tGet to scrubbing! An old Cook said, throwing a bucket of dirty soap water on the floor near the Princes feet.\tWith a start, the Prince came to and looked all about him. He was in the lower levels of the castle, in the big kitchen, his body covered in dirt and grime. His whole body ached as if he had spent all day running and playing.\tNow, come here you scullery maid, I want to see how well youre getting on. The cook said.\tWhat? The Prince replied, and then looked down, his body had changed! He was now a girl, dressed in a shabby peasant dress and no shoes on his feet. In his hand was a mop. What did this Fairy Godmother do to me? He asked himself as he began to mop the floor.\tThe Princes days were filled with mopping the floor of the grand kitchen, scrubbing the pots, and helping the Cook when she needed it. He was never left alone to do what he wanted, and his bed was a little mat by the fire. He was always getting into trouble for doing things wrong, and his body hurt more than he could have ever thought possible. This is worse than before, I hate this! I want my old life back! He cried one night.\tAs the Prince sat crying alone in his room, the Fairy Godmother appeared before him once more.\tMy dear little Prince, whyever are you so sad? Is this not what you wanted? A life different from what you had?\tYou must think youre so very clever, Fairy Godmother! This life is the worst yet! I hate being a scullery maid! I have to wear all of this, and am never allowed to go play outside and forced to clean all day! Its the worst yet. I want my old life back! Please Fairy Godmother, what can I do? Surely you can help me. He pleaded before her.\tBut my dear little Prince, did you not want a life different from your own? Are you sure you want to go back to your lessons and be a prince?\tThe Prince looked up and dried his eyes. Yes Fairy Godmother, I have learned that I like my lessons, they are more interesting than I had thought before. I like running around the garden, even if I cant climb a tree. I didnt know there could be anything worse but now I do. I am grateful for all I had. Please Fairy Godmother, let it be as it was.\tYou have true repentance, and that is your salvation. Go to sleep now my little Prince, and when you wake all will be as it was.\tSo the Prince did as she said, and climbed onto his little mat by the fire. When he woke the next morning he was back in his old bed, his dress gone and replaced with his shirt and trousers. Hooray! I am back to my old self again! He said with delight. He ran around his room, hugging his toys and books. He went on to become known as a smart lad, who was studious with his lessons, and as kind as his father. He never talked down to the servants, especially the scullery maids, and showed respect to everyone. He and his kingdom lived happily ever after.",

          "context": "When I hear such statements in my life ,I used to think what might be the reason for them not getting their work fulfilled. Why are they ending with out completing the task.Many questions do arise in my mind thinking of the actual reason for their delay.By the way,let me first introduce you to me & my environment & then I will take you to the exact intent of what has happened & what I realized from the saying which I mentioned above.I am a student ,an undergraduate pursuing bachelors in technology in the stream of electronics in a reputed university located in my state of living . Being part of the university academic schedule, I always used to be in the classroom ,fully busy in listening to lectures. When I get a day off or a kind of dept holiday in the mean,then I will spend my time in fulfilling my hobbies. My most interested hobbies are to write about what I am actually interested in at the moment & will also design the content related posters or posts,which are user friendly in nature. Apart from the hobbies,I do spend certain time on my academic scheduled works like assignments,ALM's and will spend the rest of my time getting inspired from the great stories of women from the podcasts & YouTube stories.And this is on the day when I am a bit free with no lectures but was asked to come to campus so as to submit an assignment. I was waiting in the lobby for the time to rotate to reach 12 pm ,where I will get the chance to meet my trainer to submit all my assignments. I was simply sitting in a chair & scrolling the feed on Instagram. Then I suddenly heard a girl speaking to her friend ,in a low voice ,in a sorrow tone ,telling that she is a bit worried. By listening to her statement,My attention slowly moved to her, eager to know the reason for her sorriness.She slowly started continuing the statement saying that : \"I am really worried because I don't know why I am like this today in an helpless way.\" Her friend asked to tell her what exactly had happened. She continued by telling to her that she is missing her passion ,she is out of her world of dreams and living a life which she is not actually intended to. This made me question myself that \"What ,Is she telling the truth!? \".While i was in my query mode,I heard her continuing in expressing her exact view.She told that:\" Being busy in academics,I am not being able to concentrate on what I am actually interested in.I am not getting enough time to build my career as I expected. I am even trying to make time,I am only getting chance to manage only one of my passions as hobby in a day.This is the reason for my sassiness of the day.``Then her friend asked \"If that's the reason,Why can't you quit spending time on your hobbies & just focus on your academic career. Then with no second gap,The worried girl replied in an anger tone \"What are you talking about !? These are my true dreams ,my passions,I thought of making them as a day routine,Just imagine how much i love them for the reason I even decided to make them as a daily hobby.\"After listening to it,her friend apologized in a pleasant tone & she requested that it will not be repeated again & again.By listening to all these, I was completely stuck thinking about what is happening today. Why are the things not organized? Her sassiness really disturbed me. I questioned myself that am I really being able to manage things.Then my brain answered me that I am not actually managing work. I am already skipping many tasks that I dreamt off & was into only very minute things on the list. Then I realized that I am also in ways similar to her but just a step ahead when compared to her as I am capable of managing at least more than one hobby a day.This made my thinking much deeper into the thought. I compared myself from the pastto the present ,there is no major change in me. I am just still working on things to get on with a change but its still not into the track of what I am expecting. I started digging the reasons for not completing or not even initializing my hobbies of the day. I explored all the reasons from the day of my dreams & ended up with certain reasons where I felt very bad.The worst reasons that i figured out are as below :All the above mentioned reasons that i figured out are completely waste. They are not at least the proper reasons one can figure out.They are no way valid in showcasing to myself that I am actually busy & thats the reason why I didnt initiate the other few which I thought of. This way of exploring my past made me stuck for a while. It made me realize that its not about picking multiple different hobbies in a day to work for. Its all about how we manage to do & how we pay attention in aspiring for the job we do,Loving what we do is the real love we receive as a result no matter what kind of hobby it is.Also understood that need to stick to whatever hobby we choose,explore all the ways of getting succeeded in it. From then,I decided to overcome all the above mentioned tasks & start working on my paths.The new learning that i inculcated is :Its all about the way you organize things,the way you schedule tasks & the way you love the work you do!",

He is given a piece of enchanted wood, and as soon as Geppetto carves the puppet, which he namesPinocchio, he begins abusing the old man. Once its feet are made, Pinocchio runs away, and Geppetto is arrested when he seizes the puppet. Pinocchio returns to Geppettos home alone, and when theTalking Cricketadmonisheshim, Pinocchio kills the cricket. Going his own way, and ignoring all advice, Pinocchio soon falls in with a variety of bad characters, particularly the Fox and the Cat, who scheme to steal the five gold pieces Pinocchio was given for Geppetto. Eventually, the Fox and the Cat, disguised as Assassins, hang Pinocchio to get the gold pieces.However, the Fairy with Azure Hair saves Pinocchio at the last moment. When Pinocchio lies to the Fairy about the gold pieces, hisnosegrows comically long. Later, Pinocchio again falls in with the Fox and the Cat, who trick him out of his gold pieces.

Itspedagogicalmission notwithstanding, the story remains a timeless classic. It was translated into numerous languages, with an English-language version first appearing in 1892, and it was released under several titles. Also, the book was adapted for film, television, and theatre. TheDisneyfilm is the best-knownadaptation, though it is significantly different than the book, which is darker and portrays Pinocchio as more selfish and aggressive. However, the book has some humorous slapstick that is absent from the Disney version.(/pnoki.o/;Italian:[le aventure di pinkjo]), also simply known as, is anovel for childrenby Italian authorCarlo Collodi, written inPescia. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animatedmarionettenamedPinocchioand his father, a poorwoodcarvernamedGeppetto.It was originally published in aserialform as(Italian:) in the, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes at Chapter 15, but by popular demand from readers, the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882.In February 1883, the story was published in a single book. Since then, the spread ofon the main markets for children's books of the time has been continuous and uninterrupted, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide.A universal icon and ametaphorfor thehuman condition, the book is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has had a great impact on world culture. PhilosopherBenedetto Crocereputed it as one of the greatest works ofItalian literature.Since its first publication, it has inspired hundreds of new editions, stage plays, merchandising, television series and movies, such asWalt Disney's iconicanimated version, and commonplace ideas such as a liar's long nose.According to extensive research done by thein the late 1990s and based onUNESCOsources, the book has been adapted in over 260 languages worldwide,while as of 2018 it has been translated into over 300 languages.That makes it themost translated non-religious bookin the worldand one of thebest-selling booksever published,with over 80 million copies sold in recent years(the total sales since its first publication are unknown because of the manypublic domainre-releases begun in 1940).According toFrancelia Butler, it remains \"the most translated Italian book and, after theBible, the most widely read\". The story begins inTuscany, Italy. Acarpenternamed Master Antonio, but whom everyone calls Master Cherry, has found a block of wood which he plans to carve into a leg for his table. When he begins, however, the log shouts out. Frightened by the talking log, Master Cherry gives it to his neighborGeppetto, an extremely poor man who plans to make a living as a puppeteer in hopes of earning \"a crust of bread and a glass of wine\". Pinocchiothrows a hammer at thetalking cricket.Geppetto carves the block into a boy and names him \"Pinocchio\". As soon as Pinocchio's nose has been carved, it begins to grow with his congenital impudence. Before he is even built, Pinocchio already has a mischievous attitude; no sooner than Geppetto is finished carving Pinocchio's feet does the puppet proceed to kick him. Once the puppet has been finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and away into the town. He is caught by aCarabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons by Geppetto.Left alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat. Once he arrives at home, atalking cricketwho has lived in the house for over a century warns him of the perils of disobedience and hedonism. In retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, more accurately than he intended to, and accidentally kills it. Geppetto is released from prison and makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet.Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but what comes out of it is a little bird that flies out the window forcing Pinocchio to leave the house to ask for food. Then he knocks on an old man's door to ask for food. The man thinking that Pinocchio was one of the hooligans who ring the bells for fun, and instead of giving a good piece of bread all he gets is a bucket of cold water on his head. Wet Pinocchio comes home and lies down on a stove, but the next day when he wakes up he falls to the ground with burned feet. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison and makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school, and Geppetto sells his only coat to buy him a school book.   The puppet masterMangiafuocoOn his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre, and he sells his school book to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppetsHarlequin,Pulcinella,and Signora Rosaura on stage recognize him in the audience and call out to him, angering the puppet masterMangiafuoco. Upset, he breaks up the excitement and decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his lamb dinner. After Pinocchio pleads to be saved, Mangiafuoco gives in and decides to burn Harlequin. After Pinocchio pleads for Harlequin's salvation, Mangiafuoco gives up. When he learns about Pinocchio's poor father, he ultimately releases him and gives him five gold pieces to give to Geppetto.   As Pinocchio travels home to give the coins to his father, he meetsa fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame. A whiteblackbirdtries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the blackbird is eaten by the Cat. The two animals convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city ofCatchfools, they will grow into a tree with gold coins.They stop at the red lobster inn, where the Fox and the Cat gorge themselves on food at Pinocchio's expense and ask to be awoken by midnight. Two hours before the set time, the pair abandon Pinocchio, leaving him to pay for the meal with one of his coins. They instruct the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio that they left after receiving a message stating that the Cat's eldest kitten had fallen ill and that they would meet Pinocchio at the Field of Miracles in the morning.  The Fox and the Cat, dressed as bandits, hang Pinocchio.As Pinocchio sets off for Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears, telling him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again. As he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised asbandits, jump out and ambush Pinocchio for robbing him. The puppet hides the coins in his mouth and escapes to a white house after biting off the Cat's paw. Upon knocking on the door, Pinocchio is greeted by a youngfairy with turquoise hairwho says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the bandits catch Pinocchio andhanghim in a tree. After a while, the Fox and Cat get tired of waiting for the puppet to suffocate, and they leave.  TheFairysaves PinocchioThe Fairy has Pinocchio rescued by summoning afalconto get him down and having herpoodleservant Medoro pick him up in herstagecoach. The Fairy calls in three famous doctors to tell her whether Pinocchio is dead or not. Two of them, anowland acrow, are unsure of Pinocchio's status with the owl claiming that Pinocchio is alive and the crow claiming that Pinocchio is dead. The third doctor is the Ghost of the Talking Cricket who says that the puppet is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy administers medicine to Pinocchio who consents to take it after fourundertakerrabbitsarrive to carry away his body. Recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what has happened to the gold coins, and his nose grows until it is so long that he cannot turn around in the room. The Fairy explains that Pinocchio's lies are making his nose grow and calls in a flock ofwoodpeckersto chisel it down to size. The Fairy sends for Geppetto to come and live with them in the forest cottage  Pinocchio and the gorilla judgeOnce Pinocchio returns, he learns of the Fox and the Cat's treachery from aparrotwho mocks Pinocchio for falling for their tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse where he reports the theft of the coins to agorillajudge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio's plea, the gorilla judge sentences Pinocchio to four months in prison for the crime of foolishness as he is taken away by twomastiffsdressed asGendarmerie. Fortunately, all criminals are released early by the jailers when the unseen young Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army's victory over the town's enemies. Upon being released by stating to the jailer that he committed a crime, Pinocchio leaves Catchfools.    Alidoro saves Pinocchio fromthe Green Fisherman.Upon arriving on the Island of Busy Bees, Pinocchio can only get food in return for labor. Pinocchio offers to carry a lady's jug home in return for food and water. When they get to the lady's house, Pinocchio recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now miraculously old enough to be his mother. She says she will act like his mother, and Pinocchio will begin going to school. She hints that if Pinocchio does well in school and tries his hardest to be good for one whole year, then he will become a real boy.Pinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, but this makes the other schoolboys jealous. The other boys trick Pinocchio into playing hookey by saying they saw a largesea monsterat the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, the boys were lying and a fight breaks out. One boy named Eugene is hit by Pinocchio's school book, though Pinocchio did not throw it. Pinocchio is accused of injuring Eugene by two Carabiniers, but the puppet escapes. During his escape, Pinocchio saves a drowning Mastiff named Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio fromThe Green Fisherman, who was going to eat the marionette as Pinocchio returns home. After meeting the Snail that works for the Fairy, Pinocchio is given another chance by the Fairy.  The wagon ofthe Coachmanthat leads the boys in theLand of ToysPinocchio does excellently in school and passes with high honors. The Fairy promises that Pinocchio will be a real boy the next day and says he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked when he meets a boy nicknamedCandlewickwho is about to go to a place calledToylandwhere everyone plays all day and never works. Pinocchio goes along with him when they are taken there byThe Coachman, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.   Pinocchio andCandlewickbecame donkeys.One morning in the fifth month, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys' ears. ADormousetells Pinocchio that he has got a donkey fever: boys who do nothing but play and never study always turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed. Pinocchio is sold to a circus by The Coachman. He is trained by theringmasterto do tricks until he falls and sprains his leg. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and make a drum. The man throws the donkey into the sea to drown him. But when the man goes to retrieve the corpse, all he finds is a living marionette. Pinocchio explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again.   Pinocchio finds Geppetto inside theDogfish.Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea. When the Terrible Dogfish appears, Pinocchio swims from it at the advice of the Fairy in the form of a little blue-furredgoatfrom atop a high rock but is swallowed by it. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, who has been living on a ship inside there. Pinocchio and Gepetto with the help of a tuna, a companion inside the Dogfish, who, following his example, managed to escape and took them on his back to the mainland. Pinocchio gave a kiss of thanks and left with his father in search of a place to stay.  Pinocchio recognizes the farmer's donkey as his friend Candlewick.Pinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat who are now impoverished. The Cat has really become blind, and the Fox has really become lame and is also thin, almost hairless, and has chopped off his tail to sell for food. The Fox and the Cat plead for food or money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that their misfortunes have served them right for their wickedness. Geppetto and Pinocchio arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The Talking Cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for Farmer Giangio and recognizes the farmer's dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.  Pinocchio becomes a real human boy.After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money. Pinocchio instantly gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all the money he has.That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy at last. His former puppet body lies lifeless on a chair. Furthermore, Pinocchio finds that the Fairy has left him a new suit, boots, and a bag in which he thinks are the forty pennies that he originally gave to her. Instead, the boy is shocked to find forty freshly-minted gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health.",

          "context": "One day I was chatting to the old guy who lives in the garden apartment below. Interesting. It turned out that he has two brothers who were authors of fairy tales. Were their stories published? I asked.Sure! he said. And how! Their best stories made them rich. I never got any of it. I am the little piggy who got none. He laughed. Like in the nursery rhyme, I said.Exactly!Tell me about one of their fairy tales, I asked. I will. But Ill make coffee first, he said. By the way my name is Elias, he said as he went into the kitchen.And Im Pete! I called, being friendly.  Their most famous tale was about the little girl who was kept locked up in a tower with a spinning wheel that spun straw into gold. So every day they went out and gathered straw, took it to the castle and she spun it into gold. And every morning they swept up yesterdays gold production, took it downtown and sold it to a jewelry maker. Boy did they make money! They were filthy rich! One drove a Ferrari, the other an Aston Martin. Big playboys around town. Gambling, horses, women, all that rich mans stuff, you know. Are they still in business? I askedNah. All good things come to an end, sonny. Especially when its that good.What happened? I asked. The little girl died?Nope. Nothing so dramatic. The price of gold dropped. They were producing so much that it affected the price. Eventually, it hardly paid them to sell the stuff. I have some somewhere. Next time you come Ill give you a bucketful. Just remind me. My memory, you know. So what are they doing now? I asked.They are trying to melt the stuff and make coins out of it. But its not so easy. Why not? Should be a piece of cake!It seems you have to get government approval, then register it and get another approval from the World Bank. Theres all sorts of red tape to prevent private people from making their own money and flooding the world with worthless currency. The boys are working on it. Its hard to know what to do with a daily production of gold. There are conmen and thieves on every corner. Everyone wants to get hold of gold. Even I cant get in on their act.  What a fascinating story, I thought, drinking my coffee. Back in my apartment I wondered if I should drop all work on my book and write articles. The first one would be about my neighbors brothers, the money-makers. Im sure the papers would buy it. I could use the dollars Being an author is some challenge! Time passed and I greeted the old man every time I saw him. I was working on my book and having a rough time with it, so I spent most of my days hunched over the computer and muttering away to myself. I went out only when it was absolutely necessary. One day I walked past the old mans balcony on my way back from a trip to the bakery and deli. Bought some great sheeps-milk cheese. I had also dropped in at the bank to cash a $100 check I had received from the Mirror that morning. They had finally bought my article on deadly plagues. The bank, of course, was closed. It always is when you need it.  Aha! Ive been waiting to see you, old Elias called as he spotted me. I waved.Theres news! he shouted. My brothers made it! They got all the necessaries to go ahead with their new money! That stopped me in my tracks. Great! I said. Where can one get it?You have to look for it. They are advertising it on the internet.The internet? Whats it called?Bitcoin, He replied. Theres only a single-value coin. You can buy as many as you want.What can I do with them?I really dont know. I forgot to ask. Just buy them and throw them in a drawer. One day they may be worth something. Maybe youll double your money, haha!  I stared at him. He forgot to ask?I only know one thing about them, he said.Whats that?My brothers will make more millions. Zillions, maybe. Those guys never miss.Amazing! I ventured. Are these your older or younger brothers?Younger. Much younger. I am 88 and they are 68. Twins. Go everywhere together. Dress the same. Look the same. Think the same. Chase the same women. Sometimes I think it must be pretty boring. How many Bitcoins are you planning to buy?Um, havent actually thought about it yet. On a whim and wanting to hear more about his brothers, I said, Come up and have coffee at my place. I make good coffee and I just bought some great cheese.Thank you, I will be up in a few minutes.Seated at the table with cups of coffee in front of us and plates piled high with slices of rough peasants bread and a steadily diminishing block of cheese, I asked, so what do these Bitcoins cost?One dollar each.Wow, thats cheap!  And then I had a rush of blood to my head via the $100 check in my pocket. Ill take a hundred! I announced grandly.Good man! he exclaimed. I love it when people support my brothers. Tell you what, I have a few here. Im giving these to you. No charge. A gift, neighbor to neighbor. Okay? Thats very nice of you. I appreciate the gesture. Have some more cheese.I cannot. Thank you. I must go now.He had given me 18 coins. I cashed the check next morning and bought the 100 Bitcoins. I now had 118 taking up space in the drawer with my socks.  Its now exactly 10 years later. I open the morning paper to look at the price of Bitcoins. These days I look twice a day. A little short of $60,000 each. By noon today I will have 7 million bucks in the bank. And old man Elias, somewhere up in the clouds above my head, must be laughing his head off.  Me? I plan to live happily ever after.",

          "context": "Aedna sputters to the surface, blindly thrashing her legs and arms. The Pinkietoads leap from their lily pads, diving underwater, watching in wide-eyed wonder at the strange creature flailing in their pond.At last, Aedna opens her eyes. The pond is ringed by trees, but not the kind of trees she knows. The silvery bark sparkles in the sunshine, and the purple leaves whistle in the breeze as she swims awkwardly toward shore, finally standing when her feet find the muddy bottom.Two grey-ish green trolls, out for their afternoon stroll, gawp with open mouths, their sharp teeth glinting.What sort of creature is that? Borrarorr asks his wife.I think it may be a human child, Klaradair replies.But humans cant cross over to this realm.It did. Its here.Aaahhhhh! Aedna screams, on seeing the trolls.Aaahhhhh! the trolls reply in greeting.Am I dreaming? You cant be real.Pinch yourself and see, says Klaradair.Ouch!Whats your name, human child?AAedna. Where am I? Who are you? Whats going on?I am Klaradair, Klaradair says, then points to her husband, and this is Borrarorr. Youre in the Queendom of Faerfolk. As for how you got here, or why, we dont know.The last thing I remember, I was walking in the forest. Aedna says, wringing some water from her long dark hair. Id fought with my Mom, and kinda stormed off into the woods. I saw a beautiful blue butterfly and followed it deeper into the forest. And then I got really sleepy, so I slept on a bed of pine needles. And when I wake up, Im nearly drowning in that pond.You must be here for a reason, and we must find that reason, otherwise the Queen will have your eyes, says Borrarorr.My eyes? What for?Human eyes, emerald eyes, such as yours, would be a treasure beyond measure, Borrarorr says, as Klaradair nods in agreement.How do I find out the reason why Im here?First we must determine, what useful skills you have,\" Klaradair asks.Skills? I'm eleven. I don't have skills, like grown-ups do.Can you spin flax into gold? Borrarorr offers.Whats flax?Can you play the lyre, or harp, or Klaradair asks.No. I don't even sing very well.The trolls frown. Thats too bad. Were looking for a singer for our jazz band, Borrarorr says.A raven lands on a nearby log. Good afternoon, Poe, say the trolls. Poe nods and pronounces:Caw!The Queen approaches on the roadTo gather Pinkie- and MurktoadsThe green-eyed girl from humankindIf she dallies, shell soon be blindCaw!If we stay here, Queen Thalia will find her and pluck out her pretty eyes, Klaradair says.If we take her home and the Queen finds out, shell make a crown from our teeth, says Borrarorr.Then we cant let the Queen find out. Klaradair says, beckoning Aedna to follow them into the forest.**After an hour they reach a small hut with a thatched roof. Borrarorr stokes the fire on the hearth as Klaradair pours hearty broth into bowls and sets them on the rough wooden table.You can have Baggas room, says Klaradair. Thats our son. Hes a drummer, on tour with Tubadoors until winter.Ithank you, Aedna says, sipping the broth. You said everyone must have a reason, to be here. Whats yours?Well, we used to collect tolls at the bridge, says Borrarorr. But we werent making enough gold for a sufficient tribute to Queen Thalia. So we started playing music, and now Faerfolk travel far and wide to hear us play.So, every creature has a job. And they have to give their money to the Queen?We must all pay tribute, yes. From the Murktoads to the Nightvales, from the Pinkietoads to the Muse-Ravens, from the Bridge Trolls to Shadowgales, each and every inhabitant of Faerfolk Queendom must contribute, Borrarorr says.If they dont, he continues, the Queen extracts the things that make each creature beautiful and unique. Shes scraped the shimmering scales from the Pinkietoads, and bottled the deep brown eyes of the Murktoads.Snipped the gossamer wings of the Nightvales. Klaradair adds, Stolen sorrowful songs from the Shadowgales, and... she says, glancing at Poe whos perched on the windowsill, ripped the rhymes from the Muse-Ravens.Thats terrible! Why dont the Faerfolk refuse to do what she says? Aedna asks.Shes too powerful. Her magic has only grown stronger, and she can pay for a large army to protect her, Borrarorr says.\"There must be something the creatures could do,\" Aedna says, trying to stifle a yawn.Youve had a long day, child. Why dont you rest, now, Klairadair says, leading her to a cosy bedroom.Aedna falls into a deep yet restless sleep. Black wraiths chase her through the forest, she stumbles and falls in the dark. Gets back up and falls again. The wraiths get closer and closer until they encircle her. An elvish Queen approaches. Shes beautiful in a cruel way, like a solitaire diamond, all edges and angles, her pale face reflecting in a never-ending hall of mirrors.She brandishes a silver spoon, the edge razor sharp, as she glides toward Aedna. Ill have your emerald eyes-s-s-s, little one, she hisses. so pretty, Ill scoop them with my silver spoon. And make some lovely earrings-s-s. The wraiths hold her down as the Queen nears. The cold sharp edge of spoon slices intoNooooo! Aenda screams, waking in the unfamiliar room, covered in sweat and breathing fast.Klairadair bursts through the door, a small candle in her hand. She sets it on the side table and sits on the edge of the bed. Whats wrong?I, uh, I had a bad dream I guess. The Queen was chasing me. AndAnd what?I miss my Mom.Im sure she's missing you too, terribly. Well find a way to get you back.**In the morning, as they sit round the table, drinking a woody-scented tea, Borrarror says, We dont have much time. The Queen has spies everywhere. If she doesnt already know about you, she soon will.She knows about her, Klaradair says, the Queen chased Aedna in her dream, just last night.Borrarror and Klaradair exchange worried looks.So, we must find your talent today, Borrarorr says.I, Im not talented in any way, says Aedna, staring into her mug of tea, Im ordinary. Maybe less than ordinary, if thats a thing.Everyone has some talent, Borrarorr says. Sometimes it takes a while to discover it, but you have it already. We just have to find it.What have people told you that youre good at? Klairadair asks.UhIm good at daydreaming, and sloppy handwriting, Aedna says, according to my teachers. Im good at not listening and being wilful and stubborn, according to my Mom.Hmmm, not sure how we can make those into something people would pay for says Klairadair. There must be something else you excel at. Think hard. Someone must have praised you for something?My Grandma says Ive got an active imagination, the way I make up stories from thin air. Does that count?Yesyes. You could spin fantastic stories.Okay. I think I remember some fairy tales, like Hansel and Gretel.What are fairy tales? asks Borrarorr.Theyre uh, stories about magical lands and creatures. And people getting into trouble, and then finding a way to get out of trouble. And then living happily ever after.Sounds like nonsense to me, but it might work, he says. But youll need to tell the Queen a tale that really impresses her.What does she like?Gold. And more gold. And ways to get more gold.Okay, so shes greedy. I know plenty of stories about that, Aedna says. If the Queen likes my story, will she return me to my Mom?The Queen has the power to do so, Klairadair says, but if she thinks she can spin gold from your stories, then theres not much motivation for her to let you go.Their conversation is interrupted by Poe, who lands on the windowsill and says,Caw!The Queen pursues, arriving soonWith her ogres and sharpened spoonSpin your tales to earn the goldOr lose your eyes and here grow oldCaw!**The Queen arrives in a gold carriage bedecked with jewels and pulled by seven strong, sweaty ogres. Her silver skin shimmers in the sunlight. Atop her fine platinum hair sits a golden crown, embedded with the sharp teeth of trolls and the sorrowful eyes of Murktoads. Borrarorr and Klairadair shiver, despite the warm sunshine.Trolls-s-s, she says, Are you hiding a treasure here? You know the punishment for that.No, your highness. We are keeping the human safe, so that you may hear her wondrous stories,  Borrarorr says, bowing deeply.Stories-s-s you say? They better be worth their weight in gold, or Ill have those emerald eyes-s-s for my crown.Oh, its a doozy of a story, Aedna says, swallowing hard.Chair! the Queen shouts. One ogre gets down on all fours while a second covers him in a plush carpet. Backrest she says. The second ogre drapes a carpet over his head and stands next the first. The Queen sits on one ogre, leaning her back against the other.You may begin your story, the Queens says. No wait. Ogre, bring me my silver eye-plucker. A third ogre retrieves the silver spoon from the carriage and gives it to her. The Queen nods toward Aedna.Aedna begins, Ah, once upon a time, in the land of the humans, there was an ugly duckling. The duckling was so ugly that its parents could not bear to look upon itBorrring, The Queen says, yawning.Aedna looks at the trolls, who nod encouragingly.But one day the duckling happened upon a witch in the woods, Aedna continues, And the witch took pity on the duckling and granted him a single wish. The duckling thought for a long time about what he should to wish for. Finally he said, I wish to be wanted by everyone.\"And, uh, Aedna trails off for a second as the Queen sharpens the spoon against the fourth ogres teeth. Then, then the witch waved her bony hands and chanted something. And whoosh! The duck turned into something beautiful. He became a goose, a girl goose who could lay eggs. But not just any eggsThis goose could lay golden eggs.The Queen leans toward Aedna, her pointed ears twitching.And people came from far and wide to see the Goose who lays the Golden Eggs. And the Goose was very popular. All the cute boy gooses, er, geese, asked her to dance. The other girl geese were very jealous.Where is this Golden Goose now? You must take me to it at once, the Queen says, standing and striding toward Aedna.Ah, well, the Golden Goose is, uh, its a storyAn amazing true story, Klairadair interrupts, staring meaningfully at Aedna.Uh, yeah, sure. A true story. And the goose is, is my friend. We hang out sometimes, because, she likes to hear my stories. And she gives me eggs. So, I have like, loads of eggs in my room. And Mom is like, Aedna, you have too many eggs. And Im like, chill out Mom, I'You will show me this goose.Yeah. But its back in, um, my land, with the humans, soThe Queen removes her crown, holding it in front of her, like a large ring resting on its side. Put your hand into the crown ring, she commands.Aedna slowly puts her left hand into it, expecting to see it poke out the other side, but instead it disappears into the ring. The Queen adds her hand and says something in elvish. Just before they swirl into the crown-ring, Poe joins them.**Aedna lies on a bed of pine needles, staring up at a cloudless blue sky. Beside her is a mouse with silver fur and pointed ears, and Poe perched on the crown.Caw!At once the queen becomes a mouseThe magics gone, as is her houseAedna with her story prevailsFuture author of fairy talesCaw!Poe hops gracefully into the crown and disappears before it disintegrates into a small clump of sticks and leaves. The mouse looks at Aedna, ears twitching. A red-tailed hawk circles above, eyeing the rodent with interest.Aedna stands up, brushing pine needles off her clothing. A blue butterfly flits by and she follows it, knowing it will lead her home.**\"And that,\" Aedna smiles to the children sat round her in the school library, \"is how, many years ago, I learned how to spin golden stories.\"",

          "context": "Hello everyone! Im new to Reedsy; this is my first time participating in the writing challenge. I hope you enjoy my very short story. :)Maggie looked out the window for the sixth time in half that many minutes. In one hand she clutched a rosary tightly, in the other, a kitchen sponge, cold but still covered in suds from her half-hearted attempt to clean. She glanced at the clock.  Rons curfew was midnight.She clutched the rosary tighter. . Maggie glanced at her husband Lucas, collapsed on the couch where he had prayed the rosary and then read aloud until sleep overcame him. She considered voicing her concern over their teenaged son, but she knew he would tell her to stop worrying and go to bed, then he would follow his own suggestion.. She gave the window a final glance, trying to stare past her troubled expression into the shadowed outdoors, then pulled away. She stumbled with weariness that only a worried mother could exhibit. she prayed To call Ron a baby would be an understatement, especially as he dwarfed her and almost towered over his father. At eighteen and a half years old, he considered himself a full-grown man, with all the privileges and rights that came with it, even though he only accepted a few of the responsibilities that came with being a man.She began to wipe off the counter with a long stroke. . She wiped in the opposite direction, but distracted thoughts interspersed her cleaning. He had gone out with friends before, but this was the first night with a later curfew - 12 a.m. Maggie wondered if Ron knew how much he worried her. He had stopped attending church regularly with them once he learned to drive, and the number of girlfriends he had had in the time since then concerned her. She even occasionally smelled the stench of cigarettes lingering around him after one of his boys nights. What if he decided to disobey his parents, choosing to stay out later and not tell her? Perhaps the theaters food gave him food poisoning and he was lying on a floor in pain right now. What if he was injured? The terrible questions raced through her head, each worse than the last.Maggie threw the sponge into the sink with a solid Glancing through the window pane again, she wandered over to the cranky radio and turned it on. ...yeah Aaron, the traffic here on Elmer Street is pretty heavy due to a drunk-driver accident at the intersection. No fatalities have been reported yet, but its still new enough Maggie gasped and slapped the radio off again. She ran to her phone, hands shaking so hard she couldnt type her passcode correctly. She pressed her fingerprint to the sensor.. Time stood still as her phone rang once. No answer. Please, Maggie whispered, but if she were asking her son or praying to God she didnt know. Both, perhaps. Headlights signaled the entrance of a small car onto the narrow street, and her pulse quickened. But it was just the neighbors. The phone rang twice, thrice, four times. Part way through the fifth, someone answered the phone.The sound of young men laughing echoed in the background as another man spoke into the receiver. I promise we left in enough time to get home before midnight. Maggie sighed in relief at her sons irritated voice. You talking to your ? A boy asked with disbelief.Rons voice moved away from the phone. Yes, and I cant hear her. Shut up. He moved back. Sorry, . I promise I have a real reason this time-Maggie cleared her throat. Its not that. I heard there was an accident.He chuckled, releasing pent-up stress, and his voice faded slightly as he turned to his friends. Were not in trouble. Shes asking about the accident..Ron, Maggie cut in. Did you see it? Were you involved? She began pacing.Ron moved the phone away from his ear as she raised her voice. , and no, and ! Its pretty crazy actually. We left the theater almost right after the movie ended, and Noah wanted to ask the cute girl at the register for her number-Noah cut in. Dude! Are you really telling her about that?!-But chickened out and got another Coke instead but forgot a straw. So guess what idiot tried to drink from their cup  and  a straw?While Ron explained, Maggie collapsed on the couch, making Lucas stir awake. Relax, Maggs, hell be home soon, Im sure. Go to bed, he mumbled, half asleep.Maggie ignored him and addressed her son. Ron, spit it out. Youre making it sound like you got in an accident.Lucas started, wide awake now. Rons hurt?! Maggie waved him off.Hes fine, she snapped, then softened her voice. Ok, go on. She placed the phone on speaker.Hey Ron.Oh, hi Dad. So, let me be clear. . Noah spilled his drink and so we pulled over. And right as we did, this dumba-uh- driver, apparently drunk, in this huge truck whizzes by right where we just were. Hit the street light so hard it broke and fell across the road. If we had been there, n hadnt pulled over Ron trailed off, giving a breathy, relieved chuckle. But we did, soPraise God that youre safe! Maggie clutched Lucass hand.Yeah, praise God. Whether or not Ron meant it, she didnt know. But Maggie and Lucas meant it from the bottom of their hearts. Anyway we took a detour so well be home in five, ten minutes.All right. Thanks, Ron. Love you.There was a small hesitation. Love you too, Mom. He hung up amid his friends teasing.Maybe Ron wouldnt be home by his curfew, but at least he was safe.Maggie, now that you know hes safe, you can stop worrying and go to bed. Lucas stood up, stretched, and went to follow his own recommendation.",

Combining it, the result is a thing which is worth of victory or something capable of giving someone victory. Watching outside the window aspires someone to become something or aids someone not to do something in life so that catastrophe does not occur in his/ her life as well as their family members' life.Now question arises, what a window helps you to become?It helps you to become a painter by watching nature filled with mountains, cool air, flowing crystal clear waterfalls and many more. It helps you to become an NGO by helping poor people, a dancer by seeing the trees dancing to the tunes of the breeze, a motivational speaker by seeing the black clouds of depression fade away due to the motivational power of the wind, become a hiker by dreaming to scale tall and humongous mountains, a Navy officer or a navigator by sailing through the rivers, a geologist by investigating rocks, an astronomer by studying the stars and planets in the solar system, a marine biologist by studying different marine animals, and if nothing else then a writer or at the end, a matured citizen of a civilized country. A window helps you to beleive in god and his creation if you are an atheist and makes you beleive more in the the power of God if you believe in Him. It also helps you solve family issues and teaches life lessons. When one sees the tight grip of the roots holding a tree, it reminds us of our forefathers who are already forgotten that how hard they worked to earn us this living. It also inspires us to carry the same bond with our descendants as the buds of a tree do. A flower outside the window on the garden inspires us to stay blossomed and bright in the family during tough times abd give them some fragrance of help and petals of hope. A flower also teaches us to help the world and not ask anything in return. The tall mountains tell us to stay strong in any conditions as they did in different seasons and to keep your chin up even though you are poor. Black cloud teach us not to become rude with others or there will be rains of anger and disputes in the family while the clear sky tells us to become pure from the bottom of our heart. The sun teaches us to shine everyday even though the black clouds of depression cover and hover around you. The flowing river teaches us to flow even tough rocky situations come in our way while the ocean teaches us not to be lazy like her or impurities will cover you. The breeze teaches us to stay calm in every situation while a gale or a thunderstorm shows us the result of what devastation will happen if we get angry. Fire teaches us to stay lively. But on the other aspect of teaches us even to glow in the dark, sad and depressing times of your family without any fuel. A withered leaf teaches us not to get separated from our family while a trunk tells us to stay close to your family. Well let's keep aside the elements of nature but let's talk about our topic window.What can and must one learn from a window?A translucent window passes good rays of sunlight instead the harmful ultra- violet rays. Similarly we must protect our family from bad vibes of the world. In monsoons and winters, rain and snow cover the windows and prevent the sunlight to enter the house. We regularly clean the windows after snow and rain so that again the sunlight enters into the house. So taking this as an example, always realise that if you get into trouble or get yourself covered with demotivation then keep in mind that there is always a helping hand to clean you. Simultaneously, you must also help others to clean the rain and snow from their windows. Weaker windows break easily but stronger windows resist even a bullet shot from a sniper gun. This teaches us to stay strong because there are many people who learn from you.We can precisely say that a window is a dictionary of life. Let's read a similar story on this topic.It was a gloomy day when a poor lad was walking on the street, who had everything except money. His sister's marriage was lined up next week with a worthy politician who needed a car and few other things in dowry. He needed money instantly and thought to injure himself seriously by crashing himself into a truck and then bribing the driver for money. He was just watching the trucks and cars go by when an advertisement window showed up. It read someone's quote which said \"I have seen many poor people who only have money but nothing else. There are many rich people who have happiness and family in the world but no money.\" He went to the advertisement board and read further. \"The bigshots earn money without perseverance by conducting various scams and scandals as they don't have much experience and thus they fall from grace. While a poor man who is acquainted with failure does not matter loss. Every bigshot has a criminal stain left in the pages of history while a poor man doesn't. So if you think that you are poor or jobless, then work hard. Join our club where you will find your job as quickly as possible. Call on the following number...This advertisement window changed him totally. He worked hard and achieved his goal of earning money.This is the story of the Winning advertisement dow.Hope this story will change someone's life.

          "context": "There once was a groundhog named Gloria. She had an internet date over lunch at The Watering Hole, the hippest drinks establishment in town. Most animals had to wait in line to get a sip at the Hole. Her date was with a horse named Jack and they had met on Mating Call, an app where animals swipe up or down based on potential suitors photos. Cautiously, she opened the door of the bar and poked her black nose and snout into the establishment. She saw a giraffe, a cobra, a macaw, an opossum, and a donkey. No horse - she left. There once was an emu named Emilia. She also had an internet date from Mating Call at The Watering Hole. She stalked through the restaurant-slash-bar looking for her horse named Jack. Her head and lengthy neck led her body, moving with a bob through the tables. She didnt find a horse; she found a donkey with a sunflower. The profile said Jack was a palomino and sixteen hands tall. Instead, he was grey with a few wandering hairs of brown and only ten hands tall. He had a smirk to his white mouth and a foreleg looped around the back of his chair. His causal lean highlighted his portly belly. Youre not a horse. But I am Jack, the donkey brayed. Emilia did not sit down. Why should I give you the time of day if you start off with a lie? Ill pay for your food. Emilia sat down. What do you do? Jack asked. She told him that she worked in investment banking. She told him that she worked very long hours, so it was nice to get a break from the office and go on a date. She asked him what he did. Jack swirled his midday jack and coke. He had ordered it by telling the waiter that he wanted his namesake and gave an affected wink. Emilia did not order a drink. She had an important meeting after this. Jack leaned across the table and whispered, Im actually not allowed to say what I do. Contractually. Emilia gave him a piercing look. Can you keep a secret? Sure. She shrugged. Im actually a spy for the National Animal Relations Board. Emilia let slip a small squawk of laughter. He didnt hear it. Im only in town for a few weeks, tracking down this guy whos leading an illegal turtle racing ring. It would be amazing to have someone show me the sights while Im here. Jack lifted his jack and coke between his two hooves and took a sip. Her feathers were ruffled and puffed. Why did you say you were a horse on your profile? Animals tend to undervalue donkeys due to species prejudice. I mean, can you imagine the hits you would get if you said you were an ostrich instead of an emu? When animals think of an ostrich, they think of show girls. When animals think of a horse, they think of a stallion. Emilias feathers went full puff. She doubled in size. Excuse me?! An emu is a respectable, regal bird. I would never pretend I am an ostrich. They are harlots. She stood up and left The Watering Hole before her  had arrived. There once was an iguana named Indie. When she entered The Watering Hole, she was fifteen feet long instead of three. Her scales were a deep emerald green instead of pale chalk. She had no beard, no oblong spikes along her crest. Instead she had hard spikes that dotted the back of her hide, and a flat, wide nose, and a jaw that could break bones. There once was an alligator named Andie who said on her dating profile that she was an iguana named Indie. She was unsurprised to find that Jack was a donkey. OMG, I shouldve seen it! Youre a jackass. Of course, Jack would be a jackass. Its actually a family name. I get it. If you knew how many Allies were in my family, whew. Both girls and boys. Im just happy to be named Andie! Your name isnt Indie? No, that was just a typo that stuck. Her laugh was low and gravelly. Each time she laughed, the other tables looked at them out of the corners of their eyes, fur or feathers spiked. Jack gave his laugh, like a foghorn with its hees and haws. Same thing happened to me with the horse thing! So what do you do, Jack? Im an investigator for the Animal Relations Board and only in town for the next couple of weeks.  And you need someone to show you around? Exactly. It was a little awkward after his order of a hay salad, she ordered rare chevaline. She shrugged her left shoulder and said, Well, you aint a horse, so figured I didnt need to hold back. Besides that, the conversation was good. Both of them had spent some time in the South and talked a mean streak about the similarities and differences between country and blues. Andie offered to go on some sight seeing dates, maybe the River Crossing. You know, if you want, we could go back to my place. Im sure its tiring being in a hotel every night. Oh, Im not - Jack stopped himself, nearly blowing his love em and leave em cover story  - Im not going to say no to such a wonderful offer! Andie smiled, her jaw wide showing her pointed teeth. Jack paid the bill and they walked down the street. Im just around the corner, Andie said. This is a short cut. She took him into a dark, swampy alley. Moss grew on the brick. Trash, in and out of cans, lined the walls. I dont think Ive ever been on this street before, Jack said softly under his breath. His hooves splashed forward. He walked in ankle deep water that became deeper with every step. Really? All of the locals use it. Andie put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. Her claws scratched his hide. Whew, thats a tough grip you have there. The water was deep enough that Andie swam. She tightened her claw further, causing blood to run from his shoulder down his leg into the murky water. You have no idea. She opened her jaw and grabbed his back-right leg, shaking him until he lost his footing. He brayed for help and his mouth filled with water. His leg was in agony and he could feel himself being pulled deeper and deeper into the alley, into deeper and deeper water. Andie shook him back and forth, knocking his head against the right side and then the left side wall. His vision blurred and darkened. His head throbbed. He thought only of how much he hurt. The water was bottomless. His neck extended so he could still breathe. She pulled him further and his head slipped under the water. Jack was never seen at The Watering Hole or paired on the Mating Call app again.",

The wood elves are a graceful people, some very tall about six feet in height, and of fair hair, with long pointed ears. They have keen eye sight and hearing. Their reflexes are swift, and can be soft footed, so as not to alert those they walk near. Elves make wonderful hunters, gatherers, herbalists, and healers. They love all creatures of the forests, and have deep respect for nature. It is their way to use all parts of an animal in the hunt, to provide for the rest of city.      On a particularly sunny day, a child who is ninty-nine years, leaves the city. Her name is Faen. Another year and she will be an adult. She wears the cloak her mother has given her. It is special. It has magical embroidery for protection. Her bow, and quiver full of arrows are slung upon her back. Her dirty blond hair is tied up in braids with jewels and spider silk. She is wearing some leather armor, and a bold look of determination. The king has given her a quest. She must get a message to Moonsong in three days.     Faen, although only a child, is trusted with this message as she is the fastest elf in City Ravenlore. The elf tried to get her family to talk the king out of using Faen, but he insisted, as it was the utmost urgency. She had just enough lembas bread to get to the Moonsong. She also had just enough timber for two campfires. A glass bottle of endless water lies in her bag of holding. The bag is tied at her waste. The kings mage has cast a spell on it to make it light as a feather for her, so that it will not be weighed down. Faen, is not strong as others to bare the weight of the sack. There is no fanfare today for her farewell.     Taking the trail through the Starcrest Forest, Faen travels light footed. She knows that she would get farther, faster, by horse, but the king insisted that she do this by foot, so that there be less noise. Faen can hear her heart beating in her ears. She takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Birdsong is close by. Her feet fall softly on the trail. Leaves rustle down from the tree topped canopy. She is making good time heading northeast. The sun is beginning to move lower in the sky. She stops by a creek, pulls out the bread and water, and refreshes herself for just a moment. After taking in a deep breath, and soaking her feet in the cold water of the creek, she puts her feet back into her boots, and begins up the trail again.Before the sun can set, she finds a patch of grass off the trail where she can set camp. Expertly, she lights the fire with the kindling. It blazes to life. The sparks fly up to the tree tops. She takes a bedroll and lays it by the fire. The crackle of it reminds her of her own fireplace, and makes her thankful, and more at ease. She says a prayer of incantation, and asks for a blessing of protection from her deity Mielikki the Forest Queen. Faen walks in a circle and draws the shape of a unicorn head, the holy symbol of mielikki around her camp. Immediately, the circle becomes a dome of illusion so that trespassers will not see anything inside the dome. After another bite of bread, sleep comes, and then the dreams.     Faen, wakes with the sun, she is filled with a sense of foreboding. She remembers having dreams, but cannot recall what they were, but knows they were not good. She packs up camp, and leaves no sign of her trace. The second day on the path, she feels like someone is watching her. The hair on the back of her neck rises as she gets to the bridge at the waterfall.      There, on the opposite side is a goblin, sitting in a bombing tank, with his aim true and ready, for Faen. She felt something coming, but she could have never predicted this. The goblin exits his tank.His small body is scarred. His long green ears are full of earrings. He wears heavy combat armor. He has metal in his teeth. He stands on top of the tank. Then he spits.     I cant let ya pass, he looks back towards the direction behind the tank Ill offer ya a deal. Turn around now, and I wont draw me tank on ya, and have me dogs clean up, or stay, and Ill smatter ya off this here bridge. He looks Faen up and down. Either way you arent getting through.     The elf is scared, that much is true, but her people have gone up against goblins before. This time it was her against a goblin and a tank. She knows her arrows are no match against a tank. Just as she is about to turn around and make a new route north, around the goblin camp, a hawk flies against the sun, and into her field of vision.     'Ill cover you.' she hears a voice coming from the bird.     'I thank you.' Faen thinks.     'Once I make my move, you will run across the bridge, and hide in the first building on the left side. Ive already scouted it and it is empty. Caw-aw.' She hears the voice echo in her head. Its strange. She hasnt heard it before.     She looks down at her unicorn talisman. It is glowing bright white. The glow! It must be coming from Our Lady of the Forest! Faen shouts at the beady eyed creature. I will pass. Get in your machine.     At that, the goblin shuts the large metal door at the top with a thud, and climbs inside. A cacophonous screeching starts as twelve large birds come from the forest and bomb the window of the tank with berries, bugs, and bird excrement. The goblin cannot see. They begin beating their wings at the side of the tank creating further confusion for the goblin.     The slender elf bolts across the bridge at first glance of the distraction. She carefully makes her way into the first building. There, she sees a small rabbit. She remembers that the bird said this building would be empty. The building is small, and she has to crouch to fit inside. Perhaps the rabbit mistook it for a burrow. Goblin homes are small huts.     Please dont run and give me away, or squeal, she whispers to the rabbit.     Why would I do that? the rabbit replied. Im supposed to be their meal. May I come with you?     Faen takes the rabbit by the scruff of the neck and places him inside her leather armor so that his nose, eyes, and ears stick out in her bosom. He is very soft. You dont know how to get out of here do you? she asks.     Yes, The rabbit tells Faen how to sneak back out and find the main trail further away from the goblin town. She makes note that she is going to dedicate herself to becoming an acolyte to Mielikki, and create a temple to her name, if she ever makes it back to City Ravenlore.     Just as she thinks she has created enough distance between herself and the goblin town, she hears a whistle of a goblin while it is sharpening a blade. She jumps back into the shadows, opposite the sound. She watches as the goblin with a pickaxe, rounds the corner. Thatll teach them to gamble with me. it mutters. As it turns, Faen has a good shot. She readies her bow.     'Dont do it.' she hears the rabbit speaking in her head. 'You are a good Elf. I know. He didnt do anything to you.'  She lets it down on the ground.     There now. Go on. You dont have to look. They were going to kill you.     'Remember the ways of the woods, child,' the rabbit looks at the elf with tears swimming in its eyes. His ears lay flat. 'Only for defense and to take what you need.'     'You are so right, Rabbit. Revenge and fear were being served up hot and angry tonight, yes? Dont worry little one. It will be fine. I will repeat what I did last night and still get to my destination in time. Thank you for helping me remember. Hey, I just learned animal speaking today. You were a part of that. Would you like to come home with me? You could live in the palace with the king. My parents and I live in a servants home. Id give you to him.'     'What need have I of a palace? This here is my home. The leaves are my pillow. The nuts are my sustenance. I have water at the falls. Sunlight fills my day, and starlight lights my nights. My days are spent with my family happily in my burrow. I will never forget you, sweet elf. You rescued me.' With that the rabbit hops away into the forest, the light glinting off his little tail.     Faen sighs. She does repeat the steps from the night before, being very careful to secure her camp. She wants to make sure no one notices that she is there. The next morning she gets up before dawn. She has no idea how much time she must make up for the delay from the prior day. She basically glides through the trail. The silver arches of Moonsong rise up on the horizon.      Spires of silver adorned with purple Amethyst, and yellow Citrine greet the relieved elf first. She feels worn and tired, not worthy of meeting with the Lord and Lady of the fine city in the woods. Butterflies circle about, and land on every foxglove along the path. Great banners hang over the entrance to the grand hall in purple in yellow with a crescent moon. Guards come out to greet Faen first.     You have traveled far. Come rest a moment, then, you may see the Lord and Lady of Moonsong. It is good to have you here Miss Faen. At the sound of her name, the jewels in Faens hair begin to sparkle. The guards take her to a courtyard where a pond, with long white Koi swim about, and fireflies flit overhead. Ivy grows along the border, and wisteria hangs in clumps. She sits on a bench. She breathes in the sweetness of the flowers. She closes her eyes. They are heavy.     After some time, Faen is escorted to the grand hall and introduced to the royal party. She makes a long bow before them. She produces a scroll. Faen clears her throat. She shuffles nervously and takes in the royal couple. They are both beautiful. Each are decked in velvet robes of eggplant purple with gold threading. A silver moon is applied on each robe in fine stitched detail. They each wear silvery gold crowns entwined with purple and yellow gemstones. Both are autumnal brown skin hued, with sunlit golden hair, and eyes of spring grass green.     If it please the court, I have an announcement from City Ravenlore.. she reads the scroll. She has not seen it until now. King Varis, of City Ravenlore, would like to invite all eligible elves to City Ravenlore for a woodland Ball in honor of his daughter Faen Ravenlore. It will be her one hundredth birthday, and it will be suitable for her to have a coming of age ball. The ball will take place in five days time. I expect all to be in attendance. Please also note that I regret that I had to ask Faen to make this journey, rather than one of my usual guards. It was her test. When she was but a baby, a curse was put on her by a Dwarven sorcerer. She would not be allowed to live in the palace in wear our family name until she made this pilgrimage alone. I have feared every day since she was born she would not make it to see this day and read these words to you, but if you are hearing them, I would say she has made it. Congratulations, Faen, my child, you have broken the curse, and may return as Princess Faen Ravenlore. King Varis.Tears well in Faens eyes. She curtsies now before the royal family of Moonsong.     I had no idea, she shakes her head in disbelief.     Well, how could you? Asks the queen.  Everyone around her smiles and laughs.      Faen is given a wonderfully large room to sleep in that night. The bed is oak, and she falls fast asleep lulled by waterfalls outside her window, the whistling of frogs and crickets.       Travel arrangements are made to escort Princess Faen from Moonsong by elven carriage complete with royal guards from the city court. Several carriages are forming an entourage. Faen cannot believe her turn of luck. Only yesterday she was just a hunter, winning hard earned meats and skins for City Ravenlore, and now she wonders if her father would forbid her from going out to hunt for her family and replace her skills. She feels sad at that thought.     As the wheels clack against stones and twigs on the path she takes a bite of bread and a sip of water. Sleep overcomes her. When she awakens, she is told that there is not much further left to go before she is home. The horse and carriage is much faster. She is surprised that she did not see the goblin camp on the way. They must have known another route. The journey remains uneventful.     Unlike her exit from the city, her entrance is very different. Horns begin blasting. Flags are marching down stars. Confetti and streamers are flowing in the air. Ravenlore looks beautiful. Red poppies and roses are in full bloom against the black cherry wood of the city. Bright red berry bushes line the path into the city. Dark wooden carved Ravens sit boldly by the entrance to the great hall.      When Faen exits her carriage, she is careful not to step on her cloak. The ground is muddy. Her family has come down to greet her. All is ceremonious. They bow down to those in the next carriages. It is good to be home Faen exchanges stories with her family as she makes her way back to her quarters, and the guards escort the others to their temporary lodgings. That night at dinner, she tells her brother, and her mother and father, all about what happened on her journey. She even tells them about the animal speaking.So, it is true, mother said. You are the Princess after all. When they handed you to me all those years ago, I vowed to raise you as my own. They said animal speaking was something only the royal line could do and it was something you would learn the year before becoming a grown man or a grown woman. Next thing I know you will be getting the wanderlust.     I think this is enough wanderlust. I want to become an acolyte for Mielikki. Im going to ask the king during my birthday party if I can oversee the building of a temple here to her in our capitol city. She saved me. She is the one who helped me in my journey to Moonsong and helped me learn my animal speaking. Faen brightened at the thought. Again, the medallion glowed around her neck.     I think it is a good idea, but we shall have to see what he thinks. I think he wishes you to marry. Do not get your hopes up yet.     On the night of Faens party, everything is going well. Harpists are playing, dancers and singers are performing. Faen pulls the king away into a small chamber to see if he will accommodate her wishes for the small temple to the Mielikki. She also asks him about her role in the palace. The king tells her he will allow the temple to go up and she can assist in the creation. He also tells her that it will be too dangerous for her to lead the hunting party as Princess, that someone else will take over. When she hears him tell her that he will forbid her to become acolyte as well as marry as the Princess, she storms out of the chamber.     Faen approaches a dark wooden lectern at the center of her party. She stops the music. She calls forth dozens of ravens with her mind. The all sit by her side. This day, I am a woman. This day, I am also relinquishing my title and my power as Princess. I had it for one day. I am building a temple to Our Lady of the Forest who saved me, and to whom I have sworn my service. Should you wish to honor someone. Honor not me, but honor her, for by her, we have all the bounty of the land upon which we live. I am still Faen. I am still the best hunter in Ravenlore. Thank you.She exits the stage. She walks to her mother, father and brother, where they wait for her. She smiles at them, and her whole being seems to radiate with this light green glow.     Lets just go home, and let them enjoy their party, while I start planning my Ladys temple.",

          "context": "Perhaps if all life was completely unable to tell a lie, we could learn to live with the truth.Alas, we can all easily mislead others from the truth, therefore leading us to be accustomed to using lies to benefit ourselves, often but not always hurting others on the path. Lies start out simple, and they spiral.If you are not careful, they boomerang back into your face and hurt . If you  careful, you can end up saving yourself from numerous amounts of troubles.You could lie and say your paw hurts and be excused from hunting. But if your father finds out, you would be doing the sole hunting for the next fortnight.Being a fox, all the other species are already used to our lying. They expect it, accept it. But amongst ourselves, its all a battle to a fresh set of eyes with the  truth, which is often lost in the stars.In the deeper parts of the forest, mysterious happenings are always at place. Rarely any foxes are found trotting about, lest we become part of the rumors. If you are a fox, you are suspicious, sly, secretive, unworthy of a second thought on your word. Of course, thats why I was always there. They respected me to some point, the other animals. They thought me to be the only noble fox, the truth-teller. What they did not know was that I was just the best of the liars.When the self-proclaimed gingerbread man came along into our neck of the forest, I was not too surprised.*At first, I was alarmed. All the animals who saw him were. He looked like a man. A , which in the forest, is not a welcome sight.There were things about him that were inherently  however.For one, he was very, very . His face was no bigger than my front paw and his whole body less than the length of my tail. Id never seen a human up close before, but from the stories Id heard, assuming them truthful, they were much larger. And something else, his skin was odd. I dont mean too dark or too light, rather it had a flaky look to it, like it would be easily breakable.Easily edible.Not only that, but his features looked strangely artificial. Beady black eyes and a completely white, an almost sewn-on smile.All the animals who happened to be there when he arrived assessed his appearance, our ears twitching and our stances softening when we saw that whatever he was, he wasnt human.Thats when he started running.His peculiar flat body miraculously balanced itself on two legs and ran with impeccable speed. His solid features twitched and for a moment, I stood, whips of wind blowing in the slightly chilly September breeze. Oslac, a rabbit, hesitated for a brief second before running after the thing. The other animals gathered slowly dissipated, leaving me standing alone.Of course, I had to follow.Oslac was fast, his hops high and long and he never seemed to grow tired. If I really tried, I could get ahead of both Oslac and the man-thing, but I decided to stay steadily beside the rabbit, my paws barely even hitting the ground as I ran.I could see the thing right up ahead, and just as I thought, small little flakes of his skin fell with each movement.My, my, what you? Oslacs nose twitched as he spoke and we turned through the forest, tree after tree passing by in a blur. The thing stopped, and so did we, dirt and dust flying into the air as we nearly all collided. The thing blinked, or at least it seemed that way, for his unnatural eyes seemed to thin for a second.He didnt appear to be breathing. In fact, he rarely seemed alive at all, if not for the fact that he was standing of his own accord.I am the gingerbread man. I could barely register his wink, one of his eyes thinning, before he turned on his heels and was off again. Oslac sprung forward, jumping once very high and continuing forward. My ears twitched and dirt flew into my face before I followed, paws slightly aching from all the running.You might be wondering what was so special about a , about this  that we should chase him, Oslac and I. Imagine if something strange were to walk into your home and promptly start running about.Youd be compelled to chase, would you not?A guilty man runs, is that not what they say?So we ran, the old spider watching us as we flew by, afraid wed ruin his newly made web.There are certain situations, like with twisting truth, you must sabotage an opponent to win a game. Tripping someone else may be the only way to gain your own balance.Metaphorically or literally.In this case, literally.I swung my tail around and tripped poor Oslac who fell flat on his twitching nose. At least, I assume. I didnt look back as I continued running after the gingerbread man, picking up speed and no longer being held back by the rabbit.You wont catch me! The thing spoke and laughed as it ran. It was absurd, I thought, that a thing so little could run so fast.I kept my eyes on his back of sorts as we ran, never once looking where we were going or the animals passing through. I had taken it upon me that I would catch him, if it cost me my life.Dull pain coursed through my thin muscles, my red fur lined with sweat.I didnt want to stop. I didnt want to lose sight of the thing, didnt want to  at all.As I was just losing hope, the thing stopped in front of me. I halted myself and panted, staring still at the back of his head.I darted my eyes around to see why hed stopped, and I couldnt help as a grin rose to my face when it fully dawned upon me. Up ahead was the river.Multiple animals of all different shapes and sizes were scattered about, drinking, gossiping, bathing.It was a thin river, thin enough that I could jump over it if I wanted to, and had done multiple times before. It was also shallow, shallow enough that I could float in it without worry of drowning. This little gingerbread man was far too small to jump, too thin to float.He turned, but before he could do anything else, I pounced.I pressed my paws on his flaky skin and pushed him into the soggy ground. He didnt struggle much, seeing as he obviously had no lungs, no need to breathe. As soon as I pinned him down, he tried to wiggle free. A small  froze him in his tracks. I saw a small line forming between his shoulder and arm, right where my paw sat.He was breaking.I was intrigued.The only things Id ever seen  were the nuts the birds and squirrels were always dropping down as they ate. Food.Curious, I leaned my muzzle down close to the thing, sniffing long and hard. His scent was interesting, unlike anything Id ever smelt ever before.He looked scared, strangely.What do you want, why are you here? I whispered straight at his face, exhaling my words so that he would only hear them.I am here to pass on a message to the- He coughed, which was strange for a thing that didnt breathe, and I just  released a bit of my hold so hed continue. To the king. The lion.At this, I re-pushed with all my strength, and another  was heard. He whimpered.This is the forest, not the jungle.He blinked multiple times at me, weird eyes thinning and thickening again and again.O-Of course. What I meant was-I pushed my paw on his mouth, muffling his words.Are you here to hurt the forest?His eyes grew cold, more lifeless than they had been before. I moved my left paw to let him speak.You and your species and the whole forest have already damaged the forest. Im here to repair it.He had stopped struggling by then, just a thing sitting still under my paws.Something about the little circles going down his body, something about them shone like...a delicious mealworm, ready to be eaten.I couldnt help myself and stuck my tongue out just to take a small taste of the thing.He tasted sweet, unnatural. He didnt belong in the forest.You need to cross this river?He nodded hesitantly.I shall help you then, if youll only just climb on my back.The coldness disappeared from his eyes and he seemed to smile. I loosened my hold and he climbed onto my back, clinging onto my fur.All the other animals, I knew, would think I ate him. Im a fox, after all, thats all we seem to do- eat, lie, cheat.I was not completely without morals, however. I would not eat a living thing while it sat living in front of me, after I lied straight to their face.No.I flipped over on my back once I jumped into the river, and the gingerbread man fell, falling into the waves, unable to scream for help.I drowned him, where no one would catch him ever again.",

          "context": "And there it was, a feeling as if there was no identity. No gender, no real weight, no form, but feelings. I want to go tonight, mom, it could mean a chance to be discovered. OK, I am tired of hearing about this ball, really. Come here I will get you ready. Kal's mom picks up a gentle cloth, soap, and water and hands it to Kal. It's just you see the world so differently, I am afraid your feelings will be hurt by others. Mom, these scarves look absolutely beautiful and these glass slippers, um a little redundant don't you think. Don't shatter them keep them on, nobody will know even though your feet don't fit in them. But aren't I made of... Shhh, you are just like everyone else, that is if you want to be. I am just a reflection of everyone else. Kal, you must be very special, you are every color and every reflection. You are everyone and everything only better.With the right light, you can glimmer like the sun...a little blush? I will wear this pink scarf and it will reflect off of my complexion, ok. No make-up, I am one big reflection. No smelly horses for you, I will drive you over, but you need to finish getting ready. What about this bag? It is translucent. Mom, aren't I translucent enough? You are whoever and whatever you want to be. Mom, do you ever say anthing negative? No, I am lucky to have you. Come on, lets you get there so you dont miss it. She is breathtaking a woman in the crowd yelled. And those scarves, pink and green! No he is thoroughly dapper another bystander called out.The prince was mezmorized, as Kal stood in the reflection of the sun. I can barely look at her, she is the sun. Kal smiled and slowly moved toward the prince. My name is Kal, short for Kalideoscope. The prince could barely speak as Kal and he danced throughout the evening. The glass slippers were so uncomfortable and Kal could barely bear to stand, never mind dance. Kal felt the strong arms of the prince holding and lifting the glass slippers off the floor. Ah, relief at last and then they were in the garden. You smell just like flowers and you are the flowers. I am, whispered Kal. But who are you?, said the Prince. I am everyone and no one, as my mom tells me. You have lovely colors and shapes within you, geometricly formed so sharply. Well, I do try to be edgy, considering. The prince fogged up the ridges of Kals scope and said I must see you again. My car will be waiting for me, I do have to leave at midnight. But as all fairy tales must, this one has the chimes ringing loudly at midnight. OK, I have to run, call me? Just leave me your glass slipper, I will find you. A strange one, Kal thought---um, ok. Walking wobbly Kal decided it was time to dispense with the second shoe and put it in her backpack. Mom it was incredible. I danced with the prince and he said if I left my glass slippers he would find me. I thought it was weird, but did it. I hope you are not mad. After all, I did bring the other one back. What did the prince say? He said I am the sun, but I couldnt help it, there was so much glare when I walked int the room. Mom laughing, Kal, you are the sun, the moon and the stars. Oh mom! Literally, you are everything because you are made of crystals. Crystals? Mom, I thought I was made of glass? You know, Kal get me a glass of water the kids always tease me. Kal let me put my make-up on I like to look at your arm. But, you are the reflection of the beauty of the world, if you choose to stand in it. If you reflect the ugliness, you will become ugly. The Prince, saw the sun in my eyes and he thought, just like Juliet, I was the sun. Kal, you are enchanted, when you were a baby, I found you in a basket by my door. I raised you as my own and you are just beautiful in my eyes. Mom, thank you, sometimes I need a pat on the back. Well, not too hard of a pat, after all, I might break you. Um, I pretty much think that that cant happen, I am broken in some places anyway. Oh Kal..someone is at the door. Do you think it might be the Prince? Chances are, it is utilities, I forgot to pay our bill. Mom!, said Kal reaching for the door knob and finding trouble turning it. Its the utility company here to collect the check or shut off the lights. Great, here is my checkbook and thank you for coming out, I just forgot. Kal glances down and sees a box from Zappos. Kal quickly opened up the box to find the dainty glass slipper. If you are the owner of this shoe, please call the Prince at 999-5555 My shoe? I thought he was supposed to ask for water and bring the shoe himself. Short cuts for everything these days. Good thing he didnt Kal, we dont have electricity right now. Hopefully in about an hour though. Mom, let me get the other one. Kal tried on the shoe and snapped a selfie..he sent it off to the Prince. As fairy tales go, a Prince drives up in a Tesla and comes closer to the cottage. Kal or we might call her Kalerella quickly lights some candles and gets some ashes on her face. Kal, let me dust that off of you before the Prince gets the wrong idea. Oh Mom, you take great care of me. A knock at the door, a Prince holding a thermos and says, mind if I ask you for some filtered water? Oh sure, I will get it for you, said Mom as she rushed to get the pitcher in the refrigerator. Johnson, my driver, is waiting for us outside...if the shoe fits. Say you look a little different than before. It must be that we are in the dark, remember you said I was the sun. But there is no sun here, only candlelight. Ah yes, but the shoes, do they fit? Here they slide in easily, I will show you. Sliding on the shoes and lights up like the chrystal that makes Kal shine. It is you my dear, would you lke to go the Kingdom and meet my mother and father? Why yes, of course? As Kal went outside and stood in the light, the Prince exclaimed, Kal you are the sun. To be honest, sometimes I am the sun, othertimes the moon, but I am always Kal. How about we go out on a date and we find out the important things that make us tick. Tick? Yes I love clocks. Lets go! Mom, I will see you later on, it seems that it will be quite a day. Text me when you are on the way home. The door closed, the lights went on and mom blew out all the candles and smiled. My child, the sun, the moon and the stars is dating a Prince, all things are possible.",

          "context": "It's the beginning of spring, in the central city of America. The mid-age man of 45 years old is working on his laptop. He's the lazy and boring person of all time. He didn't even give time to himself or gone out for a walk in months. He was a work addict and wants to earn a lot of money. He is all alone by himself and doesn't even like talking to anyone. His life was destroyed long ago when his wife and kids left him and he lost everything on the same day. he has very bad habits considering of which lieing, not accepting his mistakes and anger range.He was the same old self with these bad habits and didn't even realize that he needs to change and give his life some time.suddenly, one day, when he was working again on his laptop, he hears an unexpected knonck at the window. he ignored it once because he thought it would be street kids. then again there was a knock. he didn't even consider that one too, but when it happened for like the fifth time, he stood up and storm towards the window to check who was so stupid to knock at the window rather than the door.he cannot see anything outside the window and opens it, shouting: 'who the hell is here '.he used to live on the 6th floor of the building and he couldn't see any street kids throwing stones at his window. he getshis head out of the window and looks down. he suddenly feels dizzy and his foot slips causing him to fall out of the window. suddenly he blackouts hitting his head on the ground. people called the ambulance and took him to the hospital. the doctor said to his family that he is in a coma because of a heavy injury to his head. he never experienced such tragedy in his life. he waked in the middle of the night and found a young boy of 20 sitting next to him. He got up from bed and sat near him.John: 'boy! why are you sad, I'm okay. who are you anyway? why you came here?.Alex: (he's talking on the phone) 'mom, I think dad would be dead anyway. he's in a coma and I don't have any hope.John realized that he was like a shadow and no one could hear him or see him. he started to fear his own exitance and ran towards the hospital exit. he is like a lost soul and runs towards his house. which is locked and he can't even enter. at the exit of the building, he sees a man sitting to beg . as john walks by this men, he calls his name.the man: 'need any help john, you seem lost'.John turns around and was shocked to see that someone could see him. he replied: ' you can see me and hear me.the man: ' yeah, of course, I'm guidance Johnhe soul, call me Ariza. I'm here to guide you.John: 'am I death'.aroza: ' no! I'm just here to you realize you turn the hourglass before time runs out. he turns an hour Johns upside down and says 'your time started now'.John: 'but I don't make any mistakes.aroza: 'that is your part of the deal. you made mistakes. you need to correct them, make it running as sand in this glass.John: ' i didn't make any mistake, it was my wife's mistake that we don't talk and her rude son.aroza: let's see what happened that daythey go back to the day when his wife and kids left him. The wife was cooking dinner and he was at work. The plumber knocked on the door and she showed him the way to sink. he was repairing the sink that Greece from sink spreads on his shirt. he takes off his shirt and starts repairing it again. his hand suddenly injuries the nail, blood was coming out of his finger. she offers him a bandage and says to fellow her. they go to the bedroom and she helps him with the bandage. John enters the house and went straight to the bedroom to check on his wife as he couldn't find her in the kitchen.John finds his wife holding the hand of the shirtless plumber. he is angry and wants to kill his wife, but he first kicks the plumber out of the house and starts fighting with his wife. they were so much involved in fighting that she forgot to turn off the fire below the kettle. John breaks the vine bottle on the shelf of the kitchen and the fire starts. As the fire spreads in a few seconds, and she runs outside. John also runs outside and didn't notice his daughter playing upstairs with dolls. her son was gone for a football match that's why he was saved. her daughter died in a fire incident and he was responsible for her death and burning their house down to ashes. this was the last time she saw john. after that, they applied for divorce and they never met.John sighs and says \" it's been 18 years and I think of that every day but it was her mistake, it was the cause of her lust that my daughter died\".John walks off to the lake near his home in the village and the aroma appears again.aroza: \"are you sure john, it was her mistake. every person pays for his mistake, one way or the other\".John: \" I'm not guilty and stop bothering me. I rather die than accept that lie .im sure she would be paying for her mistakes and suffering alone with her son.\"aroza: \" oh, if that's the cause, let me show you\".aroza takes john to Andrea's home and lets him see her life for a while. she was happy with her son and a daughter 10 years old. she married a new man and he was not that plumber. they had a small house and a nice small family of four. she was happy n d she never missed john at any moment of her life.John sighs sadly and shock takes over his thoughts.aroza: \"so you think, she's suffering, alone and painful\".John: \"I know it her mistake, she always wanted to marry another man. her wished is filled so far.\"aroza: \"let me take you to one last stop and then you can either correct your mistake or pay for it rest of your life'he takes him to the police station back when the incident took place. two officers were talking to each other about the case file.officer one: ' do you know what started the fire so fast\".officer two: \" it was the vine bottle which spread fire like in seconds\".john becomes upset and leaves to watch the sunset which he didn't watch for years. aroza comes by and sits with him.aroza: \"do you know john who suffered so far,YOU. you are the only person who suffered from loneliness and pain. inside you know, that it was your mistake so far. all these years, you didn't even apologize. it was only a word whicI'mcould solve all tI'm problems and yIucan'tld never lose your family.John cries in silence and replies: \"maybe you are right, I made mistake sorry for that. I'm really am but I can't get my family back. I lost everything.\"aroza: \"maybe the ou still l have a family, you just t have to realize who and never leave the family alone again\".aroza disappears and john runs after him but falls from the top of the building. he as I'm from the coma and I'm arounI'mhim with shock. don't his son sitting in front of him. he tries to get up but his son holds him in a hug. he says: \"I'm sorry my son, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, don't leave me ever again. \"son: \"I'm her dad, I won't leave you like this. I won't.both hugs for a long time and talks a lot about their lives. he also asked forgiveness from anderia and she forgave him but the only family left to him was his son. they started living together.you see, if john has listened to his wife and didn't accused her without reliazing it was his mistake, it would have saved his daughter and family. accepting your mistakes is a sure sign of maturity.",

          "context": "Time for bed! I heard from downstairs, while playing Minecraft. Oh boy, not again, I could hear my mom calling me. She does that every single night before I go to bed. How annoying! Well, I know she cares at least, but Id rather be playing my game than go to bed. Knock, knock, knock I hear on my bedroom door. Honey, can I come in? my mom says. I say, Okay, Ma, thats what Ive called her ever since I could talk. She brings me water and a banana with peanut butter for my bedtime snack. She still doesnt understand that I hate bananas, so I eat a piece of it and leave the rest on the plate. She tells me to turn off my game every night too. She just doesnt understand. Oh well, I guess I better get to bed since its like midnight. I hear, Johnny, go to bed right now! She hates when Im up late. Shed rather I read a book in bed first, she always says it will help me to go to sleep. Read a book? No one reads books anymore, do they? Well, I guess for school Ill have to, how boring! I better check my English homework, Im supposed to read Shakespeare. Can you believe? Im in Grade 10 and Im only allowed to use my phone for emergencies! So, no I dont have my phone with me before bed and its so difficult for me to sleep, but apparently the phone before bedtime is bad for you. Something to do with the blue lights; at least thats what my Ma tells me. But really I think its just an excuse so that I cant have my phone in bed. Finally, I decide to listen to Ma and get into bed. She is right though. I just lay here and cannot get to sleep. Then I hear from downstair, Just close your eyes, Johnny! So weird, like how does she even know when shes downstairs? She says she knows I cant sleep. I guess she is right again, because I finally close my eyes and am in LaLa Land.Watch out Ma! Screeeeeech!! Crash. I wake up sweating from head to toe. Screaming and crying. My Ma runs into my bedroom. She says, Whats wrong? Are you okay honey? Ma, Ma Im crying uncontrollably. Ma, I had a terrible dream! Youre okay. Dont be silly, Johnny. But Ma, we crashed! Please dont drive ever again. Please, please! Ma says, Oh Johnny, dont be silly, dreams arent real!The next day at school I tell my best friend about my dream and how scared I am to drive in the car. I was so scared that I even walked to school this morning. My Ma actually let me since Im in Grade 10 now and the school is close to my home. My best friends name is Phil and I told him all about my scary dream. He actually believed me. I mean hes my best friend so he has to believe me! Right?But Ma, she just wouldnt believe me, she still doesnt. Even this morning she kept saying, Dont be silly, Johnny! It makes me so mad that she doesnt believe me. I begged her not to drive, so I sure hope she wont go out today.Johnny Cash, Johnny Cash, to the office, Johnny Cash to the office I hear over the loud speaker. Oh no, whats wrong? Im thinking, I mean I never get called to the office. Are you kidding? With my Ma and how over protective she is and all her rules, Im like the best kid ever! I never do anything wrong. But truthfully, Im glad about that. I have a couple of nice friends and I never worry, because all the teachers like me.Finally, I arrive at the office to see my dad there. His eyes are all red, like he had been crying. If you knew my dad, he never cries! Are you kidding me? Hes like a macho guy, hes bald, with huge muscles and super tall! No one messes with him! Im like him though, Im already six feet tall and still growing. I have thick, brown hair like my Ma and blue eyes, like my dad. My dads name is Robert, Bobby for short. Oh, I forgot to mention, my dad doesnt live with us right now, something to do with a stupid separation. My parents dont say much, except that they need time apart for now, but dont worry Johnny. I hear that all the time too, Dont worry Johnny! I do remember one day last year, I arrived home from school to hear my parents yelling at each other. It wasnt fun to hear, so I went in the backyard, I didnt want them to know I was home from school yet and heard them. Then I heard a car screech out of the driveway only to find out the next day that my dad wasnt going to be home for awhile, if ever.Dad says, Hurry, we have to go! I get in his black Land Rover and we speed away. Dad, whats wrong? He doesnt even talk, I just see tears rolling down his face. All he could say was, Your Mom, she, she was in an accident. So, I decide to be quiet for the rest of the drive. We pull up to, St. Josephs Hospital and run inside. I hear my dad say quietly to the first nurse he sees, Colleen Cash, where is she? The nurse says, Oh shes in the ER, Mr. Cash, follow me. So she leads us to where Ma is. We find her sound asleep in the private ER room.All I kept thinking was about my dream a few nights ago. I know its terrible, but its all I could think about. Even though my Ma was laying there with all these tubes attached to her arms and the beeping noises; its all I could think about. I mean its like I had a premonition. I knew it, I even told Ma not to drive. I was so scared. My dad just stood there crying, not saying anything. Finally, I started crying too!That night my dad and I drove home in silence. I mean I still didnt know what really happened, but at least my Ma was okay. I mean I dont know what I would do if she was gone. Shes like my saviour. But she didnt believe me, I mean my dream, it was a premonition. I knew dreams had meanings, but I didnt know they could be real until now.The next morning, my dad says I dont have to go to school. Instead my dad and I go back to the hospital to see, Ma. Its weird, because Ive never once been in a hospital. Well, except for when I was born of course, but I dont remember that. We finally arrive at the hospital and go right to Mas room. Today, shes in a new room upstairs. So we go up in the elevator. Its so quiet in the hospital, much different than school! I notice my dad has a bouquet of red roses with him. I guess he really loves Ma, I mean I still dont get why they wanted to separate, but I have stopped asking questions. We walk in her hospital room and her eyes are open. My dad runs over to her and hugs her. Hes crying like Ive never seen before and Ma is crying too. Wow, thats what love is, I kept thinking to myself.My Ma had to stay in the hospital for awhile before she could come home. But my dad finally explained to me that my Ma was in a terrible, terrible car accident. Someone ran the red light; they had been drinking and driving. My dad said that Ma was so lucky to be alive, but luckily the other car swerved and hit her car from the side rather than head on. He kept repeating, Thank God, thank God, thank God. Now remember this is a man that you wouldnt want to mess with!Finally, the next day my dad told me Ma was coming home. He told me I better get back to school and that I could walk home from school, because he would be picking Ma up from the hospital. Shed be home when I arrived. So that day at school I couldnt concentrate, all I could think about was Ma finally being home. I couldnt wait! Apparently, I missed a week of school, but I didnt even realize it. My teachers told me I didnt have to worry about the work I missed. They would update me on anything necessary. Oh by the way, Ive been on the honour roll ever since I can remember, so missing a week was no big deal. I mean I get nineties without even trying.So, finally I arrived home that day and my dads car was in the driveway. My Mas car was a write-off. I guess my Ma wouldnt need her car for awhile. I run inside yelling, Ma,Ma,Ma! My Ma says, Honey, Im in the living room. I have never been happier to see my Ma. Oh and my Ma said to me, Honey, you were right. I knew she was referring to my terrible dream, but I just smiled and said, Ma, Im just so glad youre finally home, I missed you. My dad came in the living room and told me he was moving back home and would never be leaving again. I was the happiest kid ever!!",

That was the last thing I heard before my life had changed forever!I waitedin the car while my mom was screaming on the phone about a lake house in some kinda woods, I think. It was winter and 10 degrees so I hoped we weren't going there. Finally, my mom got in the car and she didn't say anything. I asked her where we were going and she said don't worry about it. At this point I was a little bit scared, like is my mom a criminal or something. An hour went by and we were in the woods where I have never been and there was a house. One house In the middle of the woods is strange. Is this what my mom was talking about on the phone? The next thing I know my mom is getting out of the car while telling me to stay here and to stay put. 10 minutes pass and my mom is still in the house. I was on my phone texting my friend Lucy. I tell her everything. Then finally my mom comes out of the house and says. To unpack my stuff, and that my room is upstairs to the left. I was confused because I didn'tpack anything, but then my mom added  go look in the trunk. So then I knew she had packed some of my things. About 3 hours later my mom had me come to the living room. When I got there she had this worried look on her face. I thought it was something about my dad, he went missing 6 years ago. Then she said something WAY different. I was shocked about what she said and I was also confused. My mom had told me I was going to have powers! She said that on my 11th birthday which was on march 9th. Of course, I didn'tbelieve her. I was in shock. So later that night I wasin my room thinking about what my mom had said. I remember I was thinking about how my birthday was in 2 days and maybe I could have powers, but then I was like there's no way I could have powers. So the next day I avoided my mom until dinner. I asked her a bunch of questions like mom were you telling the truth yesterday. then she said she was 100% telling the truth. At dinner my mom talked to me about being homeschooled and how she is going to sell our house. Those 2 things made me very mad because I would never see my house again, but then she said we would go get our stuff tomorrow. I was so mad at her because she took everything from me. The next day was my birthday, I was going to see if what my mom had said was true. For breakfast my mom had made me french toast! She told me to go outside and play so I did but I was bummed out because Lucy didn't come to my birthday. About 2 hours of me playing outside, my mom came out and told me to follow her so I did. She took me to this lake and told me my power was levtashion. I was shocked at what she said because she had a serious face. An hour later I started to feel kinda sick. I told my mom and she said the time has finally come. She also said the feeling sick was a symptom of getting your powers. 20 minutes later I was puking in the toilet and then I yelled at my mom to get out of the bathroom and she wouldn't so I yelled again and then something went up in the air (shampoo bottle). My mom told me to keep yelling at her so I did and basically everything went up in the air! My mom was so exceeded,it was dinner time so I got up to go eat dinner and all the things fell on the floor. We had someburgers and fries. 4 months go by and i have my powers undercut on and then one night my mom said she had saved our house and that we were moving back in so then 2 days later we started to get packing and then she told me that all girls that are 11 have powers and if they tell any boy they will die.  2 weeks later we were all moved in and I was hanging out with lucy, her power was Elvis's belly and we played hide and seek a lot. When I and Lucy got older (22) we were still friends and we hung out a lot. We worked in the same job we had an apartment. My mom and I went speaking because she tried to take my power and my dad was found and I was so happy and everything was so great to untell lucy created souside! sgould i do more btw dont mind the restt     jhvgjchjbkjkjkjkrblevtashionKatie, come to the office you are getting signed out.

          "context": "Gather round, those old and young. Come closer, and ye will be met with worlds of mystery. Sit at the stream, drink the sweet nectar within, and be reborn as is the phoenix from the ashes of the fire of the night. Stay at my shoes, and ye will be compelled to go forward with nothing but the stick of virtues and the sly hand. Our story begins when the moon shone above the world, moving downwards, perhaps contemplating crashing into the earth. The village was old. So old that Elder Mcallen could become one with the cracks on the buildings built near the river. The water had begun to chew on the land and spit it out as punishment for the farmers who did not wear belts on their waists. The folks would stop on their way through a town, not unlike that of the river, and use their forearms to reach the stall that was worth the suffering. There were two who never had to do this because they were already tending to the stand. It was the merchant and her husband. Their product was one thing of intrigue: a plant. This plant had a top that was reaching for the sun. The bottom looked like a childs toy that spun with magic. It was so good that the merchant and her husband would only sell to those who wanted legumes with this fantastical plant. The merchant and her husband would jingle as they walked because of it. Every 6th sunrise, the two of them would take a mare and a carriage, and go to harvest their mystical plant. They would be gone until the moon cast shadows in the water lilies for the second time. The merchant and her husband always returned with burlap sacks about to burst, ready for the coming days. The folks wanted to find the magical clouds where these plants fell from. They tried to follow the merchant and her husband into the trees that lapped at the North end of the village. They tried to be mice, to not be spotted. They tried to be snakes, wiggling among mud and root. They tried to be squirrels, pulling themselves up on branches and scurrying. Alas, to no avail. A fog covered the merchant. A mist covered the husband. Their tracks were taken with the wind. Not a soul could find the fabled spot. Those who searched would return with noses, ears, and eyes dripping red. Their hands would have disappeared. Their irises were soulless black husks that might have been portals to the underworld. Those who returned screamed in agony The nights were never peaceful. For whom the screaming was for was never clear. This was, at least, was rare. Most did not return at all, but were lost to the everlasting wood, which most likely only ended when the merchant saw fit. There were rumours that she who could not share a secret was a witch. She might need to be burned to leave the village to its tasks. The issue was that the harvest she and her husband provided was too important to the town, so she was left to do as she pleased. The merchants long hair was covered by a dirt coloured cloth that never moved. Her skirts were always stained by grass. Her face had not been washed in moons, yet she carried elegance. The villagers would cry out to her. How did she find the wonderful roots that could feed an angel? She would never let a word slip past her tongue. It was of no consequence the people who would plead, the length of their groveling, or how often they would fall to their knees and mumble into her filthy boots. The merchant had never opened her mouth to anyone who was not her husband. Even the husband was not one for canards. His small hands would be wiped quietly on an apron that was no longer white so he could touch his products. He would only speak of prices, which would always be wrong. Not one thing he said was ever the truth. The village was always frustrated by this pair. They had come here once upon a dawn and would leave twice the whisper of the night if the time ever arrived. Most would only interact for the food to give their family, and no more. A blessing from above must not be asked questions. Other whisperers did not agree. They would clench their teeth and breathe small rumors that had no base in any facts. When the sun left no shadow, a person in a ragged shawl and nothing more approached the stand. The husband and the merchant were speaking silently. The only indication of conversation was the small movement of broken lips. When the person came close, the pair turned toward them slowly. What will you be needing? The merchants husband demanded. The person, the stranger, did not offer a response. They instead focused on the husband. They traveled down his light yellow hair to his blue shirt. They lingered on a pendant, which might have been glowing with green sparks. The chain it was attached to swung off of the husbands neck. What will you be needing? The voice was louder. The stranger smiled. The plant you carry so close to your heart. The husband reached out the skilled hand he always used and picked up the special roots which made lips smack and eyes open. He picked a half dozen and laid them down on the smooth counter. The stranger shook their head. The shawl spun wildly. Their irises sparkled with knowledge. For the merchants husband was always one to lie. You have lied to me. The stranger purred. I am asking for the plant that you carry close to your heart. The merchants lips dipped downwards. She glanced at her husband. He returned the special roots to their basket. He next wrapped his fingers around an ear of corn. He lifted it and offered it to this peculiar customer. The corn was beautiful. The bland day could not reach the smooth bumps on the vegetable. It shone like the butter in the stall to the right of the merchant and her husband. It was very clean, and you might see a reflection on the yellow surface. The stranger was still not satisfied. They waggled their fingers in disapproval, and a grin showed yellow teeth. The stranger had come prepared for this trick. You have once again hidden the truth from me. What is closest to your heart, dear man? The merchant rose from her seat. She cupped her tanned hand and leaned down to advise her husband. He listened quietly and nodded. They exchanged a glance like crystals. The merchant fell back on her stool once more. Puffs of dirt rose from her skirts. The husband knitted his eyebrows and was now ready. I have not an idea what you speak of. The stranger threw back their oval head and laughed into the sky. You have lied three times, my dear. Once more, a- The folks who were in the area gasped and stumbled backward. The stranger was now lying on the ground, with a forehead of violet. The merchants husband shook out the hand which had been in a fist. Blood fell from his knuckles and dripped on the corn he had placed on the wooden counter. He did not bother to wipe it. It was of no value from this point forward. It would be cooked in a stew once the day fell. The merchant stood once more and embraced her husband. The perfect start to a day of profits.",

          "context": "Little Billy lived in a small village in rural Scotland with his family. Little Billys father owned two acres of farmland on which the family cultivated barley, wheat and potatoes.Little Billys mother gathered wood, cooked food, washed clothes and cleaned the house each day.Little Billy and his younger sister, Sally, went to school and helped their mother and father.One day, Little Billys father fell sick. He called Little Billy to his bedside.Billy, my boy, I need you to go to town tomorrow. Can you do that? he said.Little Billy jumped at the idea for he  wanted to watch the circus show in town.Yes, Father, he said.I need you to buy some seeds and fertilizer for our farm.With these words, Little Billys father asked him to fetch his black pouch from the cupboard, from which he extracted ten pounds and gave them to the boy.Early next morning, Little Billys mother packed some oatcakes and bread for him to eat during the day. She also packed some cheddar cheese and a little bottle of wine for Little Billys grandmother, whose house was on the way to town.When Little Billy was ready to go, his younger sister brought a handful of pennies, all her savings in the world, and gave them to her brother.Billy, wont you buy a doll for me? I really  want a doll, she cried.Of course, Sally. Ill buy a doll for you.Little Billy waved to his mother and sister and set off towards the town at eight oclock in the morning.At a little distance from the house, Little Billy sat under the shade of a tree and unwrapped the block of cheddar cheese his mother had so carefully packed for his grandmother. Little Billy closed his eyes and smelled the cheese. Ah, what heavenly delight! He loved cheddar and the familys only cow produced little milk, with which his mother prepared the cheese, most of which was sold in the village. Little Billy and his family only got to eat a little bit of cheese just once a month.Little Billy opened his mouth wide and took a bite of the cheese. He caressed the cheese with his tongue and smothered it with his palate, savouring the rich, textured taste. Very soon, he took another bite and another. He gobbled up the bread and the oatcakes and washed them down with the little bottle of wine.What are you doing?A high-pitched voice sounded from the branches of the tree directly above him.Little Billy jumped. Whos there?A little bluebird fluttered in the branches above, her little head bowed down to look at Little Billy. You ate the food your mother packed for your grandmother. How could you do that?I was hungry, Little Billy said defiantly.Will you tell your mother the truth? said the bluebird.Of course not! cried Little Billy, now angry. He picked up a stone and hurled it at the bluebird.The bird hovered in the air, breaking into a song.As Little Billy picked up another stone, the bird flew away, its song ringing in Little Billys ear. He burped loudly and set off on his journey again.When Little Billy neared his grandmothers house, it was nearly noon. He slapped some dirt on his face and clothes and knocked on his grandmothers door.Little Billys grandmother was a frail, old woman who could hardly see.My dear, she cried on seeing her grandson. What happened to you? Are you hurt?Little Billy wrapped his arms around his grandmothers round, cushiony waist. Im so scared, granny. Im so scared, he shrieked.Whats the matter, my dear?Little Billys grandmother ushered him to a chair and made some hot chocolate for him, which he drank in one large gulp.Some bad men attacked me, granny, he whined. They slapped me and kicked me and stole from me.How awful! My poor dear, said his grandmother.They took all my food and the cheddar cheese and the bottle of wine that Mother had sent for you. They even stole my ten pounds! Oh, what will I say to Father! He will be so disappointed. I lost all his hard-earned money.Little Billy buried his head in his grandmothers lap and began to cry.Little Billys grandmother waddled over to her tiny cupboard and collected all the notes and coins in her silver box. Eight pounds and fifty pence.With the money in his pocket and a two-egg omelette in his bulging stomach, Little Billy set out on his journey once again, smiling inwardly.When he reached the town, Little Billy went straight to the circus and bought a ticket for five pounds. For another five pounds, Little Billy rode Eli, the elephant, for ten minutes. From the circus, Little Billy went straight to the spring fair, where he spent his remaining money on various rides.When he was exhausted and hungry, Little Billy hung outside a small coffee shop, eyeing a family at a table there. Little Billy noticed that the nice family eating sandwiches in the coffee shop seemed to be well off. The mother was carrying a smart purse and the father wore a stylish hat. Their daughter wore a pretty pink dress with a satin bow around her waist.Little Billy filled his eyes with tears and tapped at the glass window of the coffee shop.The mother saw him and couldnt look away. She invited Little Billy to join them for a snack.Little Billy hogged on the plate of sandwiches, thanking the family profusely for their immense kindness.Once the plates were taken away, the man asked Little Billy where he lived.I live in the village, Sir, with my grandmother, Little Billy said timorously.Just your grandmother? the woman asked.Yes, Maam, Little Billy answered. My parents died when I was very young. Since then, I live with my grandmother in our little house on our small farm. Shes a  mean old woman. When she finds out I lost the money she gave me to buy the seeds, she will be furious. I think she might break my leg today.With these words, Little Billy dropped his head on the table and began sobbing.The woman placed her hand kindly over his head. Do not cry, boy. We will help you. Wont we, my dear? she said, looking at her husband.The man pulled out his wallet from his pocket and gave Little Billy ten pounds.Thanking the family for their kindness, Little Billy left the coffee shop and went straight to the market, where he bought the seeds and fertilizer his father had asked him to buy. He saw the dolls at a shop but decided to buy himself ice cream and chocolates with the money his little sister gave him. Little Billys pockets were once again empty.On the way out of town, Little Billy saw a blind beggar seated by the side of the road, singing a tuneless song. Little Billy sat down beside the beggar, glancing at his bowl that held several coins and a few notes.Sir, may I sit here for a while? I beg on the other side of town, but some goons stole my money and drove me away, said Little Billy.Who are you, boy? said the old beggar.Im blind, Sir.Since birth? asked the beggar.No, Sir. I was born healthy with fine eyesight. One day, as we were sleeping at home, a fire broke out. My little sister died in the fire. I was burned too, but I survived. I lost my eyesight, Sir, said Little Billy.Yes, you may sit here with me, said the old beggar, patting Little Billys arm.As the old beggar talked about his life and how he lost his eyesight, Little Billy reached out for the bowl, emptied it into his pocket and returned the empty bowl to its position. While the old beggar continued talking, Little Billy quietly slipped away, laughing silently.Little Billy set off towards his village with three pounds and eighty pence in his pocket and half a sandwich that he had saved from the coffee shop.It was nearly evening when Little Billy stopped for a short break. He sat down under a tree to eat his sandwich and decide how he would spend the money he stole from the beggar.Overhead, he heard the fluttering of a bird and looked up.The bluebird was on the tree. It broke into a song:Little Billy quickly grabbed a stone and hurled it at the bird, but it flew away.Humph! exclaimed Little Billy. Ill kill that bird if I see it again.Little Billy continued his journey towards home. It was getting dark and there were no milestones, but Little Billy was quite sure he had passed the place where his grandmothers house used to be. But now, there was nothing there! Just a tree and nothing else. How strange, thought Little Billy as he headed home.When Little Billy approached his house, the moon was in the sky. Little Billy was shocked to see that instead of his fathers two-acre farmland now stood a small, barren farmland, barely one-tenth in size. His familys large brick house was replaced by a small hut with a thatched roof!Shakily, Little Billy knocked on the door, his heart hammering in his chest. The bluebirds song kept ringing in his ears. It was impossible! No!The door was opened by his grandmother, who stood straight, could see without her glasses and wore a mean expression on her hard face.Youre late, you brat! she bellowed, slapping Little Billy across his face.Little Billy fell on the floor and rubbed his eyes. He couldnt see very clearly. Everything was becoming blurry.Where are Mother and Father? cried Little Billy.Little Billys grandmother broke into high-pitched, evil laughter. Your mother and father are dead, you stupid boy! Dont you remember, you fool?Little Billy started crying. He could hardly see anything. And... and Sally, my little sister? he whimpered.Little Billys grandmother grabbed him roughly by his shirt and dragged him to a small mirror on the wall.Sally died in the fire that turned you into an ugly freak, said Little Billys grandmother.Little Billy saw his face and body, his skin shrunk and crumpled, brown and uneven, reflected in the mirror.He shrank in horror from the monster staring back at him from the mirror and fell to the floor. As his world went pitch-black, Little Billy heard his grandmothers voice from somewhere behind him.Get to work, you ! And if you mess things up again, I swear today, Ill break your leg!",

Which was nothing new.I tossed off my comforter,sank my cold feet into my fuzzy slippersand made my way to my window.The glass feels icy cold to the touch.Normally I lean against it.Because I like it so much.I have an amazing view up here where I am.Like my own private window of the world.The buildings are still aglow, there's a thin layer of snow.The sky is clear. Not even a star out tonight.Its unusually quiet this late.I stand there and wait for cars to pass by.I love the humming sound that comes from their speakers.Sometimes, I try and imagine whose inside each vehicle.Just like I pretend to know the names of thepeople down on the street.Amy and Paul who hold hands as they pass.Jill and Steven I saw him go in for a kiss.Rachel and Maggie talking and laughing before their Uber arrives.Wouldn't they be surprised to know I'm awake.I'm just being nosy, up here in my room.I lean my forehead against the hard smooth glass.It feels good on my skin.Where is everyone tonight?No happy couple. No group of friends.I can hear a motor cycle engine but its too far away.He wont pass my window.No not tonight.I been missing you lately. Missing you so much.Which is nothing new.And I wonder where you are.Do I ever cross your mind?Do you stay awake like me?I remember how it use to be.Back then we were happy and I knew you cared.Now I'm painfully alone and I get so scared.Its been much too long since I've seen your face.My heart is shattered without youI know you need your space, I'm fine with that I swear.Just pick up the phone and call.Let me know your ok.Then I wouldn't have to worry every single day.A blue truck rumbles down my street.We use to watch the traffic together.\"Try and guess the color of the next car.\"You would say to me. Back then it was just something to do,now I'd give anythingto play that with you.I remember us holding hands as we made our way across the street.Playing Frisbee in the park way after dark.Baking a cake for a birthday dinner.You were very good, we had fun and you were only a beginner.We rode bikes to the library and the ice cream store.You sat on a stool at the counter waiting for more.The novelty shop was two doors down.We looked at the beanie babies and the baseball cards.I brought you a Grover mug.You loved it so much. You asked me.\"Do the Grover voice\" and I did it well.Oh how I miss those days.When it was just you and me.Now I'm here by myself and its killing me.I know that your different, I honestly don't care.I just need to see you I wish you were aware.A parent always wonders what their children are up to.No amount of time nor space will make me forget you.I feel like a failure.You chose to go away.But you didn't just move out, you left without a trace.And my memories are what I hold on tobecause I can longer see your face.If I could tell you what you mean to me.That your unique not like any other.Your my son and I love you.But there's so much more I would say.How I can still hear your music.Or the sound of your alarm on your phone.The color of your eyes, the style of your hair.Please come back and see me I have to knowyour still out there.If I could change the past I most certainly would.I'd let you know I'm sorry.So sorry I couldn't give you what you needed from me.Or be the kind of Mom you wanted me to be.Children don't come with instructions.They just hand them to you.Each child is different from all the rest.They will push us to the limit until we pass the test.Nobody explains that your going to f**k up,It is a thankless job and there is no pay.But its in fact the most perfect job, if you do it righteveryday.But I should've been stronger.Protected you more.And not let you leave me, just walk out the door.As I stand here in silence, I'm fully aware thattomorrow will come and you still wont be there.I want to hear your voice again.Its been way to long since I have seen your face.You'll never know my pain or how much its grown.There is a gigantic hole in the middle of my heart.The space that belongs to you.Its reserved for you alone.Please dial my number just call my phone.Let me know you still think of me.That you remember the past.It wasn't always hurt and sadness.Sometimes we had a blast.Laughing, watching movies,I would tickle under your armsyou would tickle my feet.We walked and rode our bikesin the hot summer heat.I taught you to throw a baseballand even how to throw a curve, you alreadyknew how to swing a bat.I can still see you as Darth Vaderon Halloween.Or any number of different costumesThat came in between.I look out of my bedroom windowon this cold winter night, I can pictureyou there on my sidewalk and smile to myself.This is all I have left.So I treasure it immensely.I see the top of your headand your thick brown hair.You have just looked up at me.I wave and you wave now too.I'm tired of pretending,I wish this were true.It feels worse than any migraineor physical pain.The thought of living life without youI guess I will slowly go insane.If eyes are the windows to the soul,then what are the windows to the heart?Please someone tell me.Because mine already broke apart.",

          "context": "It is late night. I am still up. You can say I am a night owl. With my work schedule being 1 PM to 9 PM, I got into the habit of going to bed at two in the morning, and I usually wake up at 10 AM. I am not complaining for now. I do have weekends off. On the weekend, I dont abuse by waking up past noon. Oh no! I kept my sleep and wake up time steady, seven days a week. I love to sleep and I enjoy naps too on the weekends, especially in the afternoon, after lunch.   Its Friday night, and the clock shows 9:00 PM! Yes! My weekend has started! I officially fall on vacation at this instant. I will be off from work for the next two weeks for the holidays. I have just noticed that autumn will end in a few hours. It is a quite cold night, with a heavy snow fall warning in effect. Winds are picking up. So glad to work from the comfort of my home.    I will order a pizza from Dominos tonight with some chicken wings and a good can of Coke. This is my little way of rewarding myself. Weekend has begun, so is my vacation. Little treat is good time to time. After supper, let me get some popcorn and find a good movie on Netflix. I feel like watching a horror movie, if not, a suspense, or mystery.   Supper was great, along with that cheesecake. I finally decided to watch The Exorcist. Again? Yes! The movie is a classic, a masterpiece of the horror genre. Almost fifty years old since its release and it still haunts me at night after I go to bed after watching that movie.    Exceptionally, tonight, I will not be going to bed at 2 AM. The pizza came in late, and therefore, I started the movie late also. I am on vacation, so I wanted to take it easy. I will wake up, perhaps, at noon. With this coffee that I had after my cheesecake; I feel great. I really dont mind a coffee late night, especially during a cold winter night. Most of the time, I can fall asleep fairly easily even after a cup of dark roast Columbian coffee.    Where I live, it is a rural area. Closest neighbor is at least a good 5-minute drive. So that tells you that I am alone when I live. Here, on cold winter nights, it could become so quiet, peaceful, calm, that gives you a sense of a very haunting place. Kind of a ghost town with one house   Tonight, I hear an owl hoot. Tonight, also, winter starts. The end of fall season in a few minutes. The winter solstice begins at 3:33 AM. Let me sit near the window of the living room before I go to bed. I will read narrative poem of Edgar Allan Poe. The Raven. Then, bedtime.    As I am about to start reading, I hear the hooting of the owl getting stronger in decibels. I look out from the window. I see a shadowy figure standing beside the tree that is a hundred feet away from my window. It looks like a man with a long raincoat and wearing a hat. I can see only his lips. I see him holding a book in his right arm. To me, someone outside, at this time, on a blowing snow night, seems quite bizarre.   The man was still for a good five minutes but now I see him approaching towards my house. What do I do? Should I call the cops? As I grab my cell phone, I see there is no service. I no longer use landline. I had disconnected the service a few years ago. Big mistake now that I think of it. Usually, cell coverage is good here though. I am looking from the window and man is getting closer and closer. As if my window is focusing only on him now. Like a lens focusing on an object. I move away from the window and close the curtains.I would not be afraid but at this time, in this weather, and I dont know this man. What is the purpose of his visit?    I hear a big bang on the front door. Three loud knocks! I froze on the spot. I am afraid. Scared. I am panicking. Who knocks on a strangers door at 3:33 AM? Wait! What? It is 3:33 AM? The time that the winter solstice begins.    I am not moving. I dont want him to know that there is someone home. Maybe he will leave. I wish I had a dog. A guard dog. I hear no noise. I sneak a peak from the window but I see no soul. The problem is that I cant see from that living room window if someone is standing at the front door. The angle does not allow it.   My feet are frozen from this cold floor. I am not trying to move. I am still like a statue. I hope this person, whoever he is, goes away. Maybe I should go to my computer and see if I can alert the authorities.    I am tired but I cant go to bed till I am sure this individual is gone from my front door. It is now 3:44. I cant stay still like this forever   I pick up my baseball bat, approach the door. Look from the peephole. No one to see. I open the door. No one to see. I look to my left, I look to my right, I look to the front againno one   I hear now again the owl hooting. Where? To my left, on the tree. It seems like it moved from a farther three to this one now. What is the significance of what just happened? Did winter come knock on my door. Is this a warning? That manthat mysterious man, he seemed like Father Lankester Merrin from the movie I just saw earlier. All these coincidences are weird. The movies I as watching earlier tonight and the start of the winter season. Is someone or something trying to say to me something",

          "context": "TW: SuicideThe night is dark. Darker than chocolate. You know what else is dark? People. Its been a week since I teleported into an unknown world. The people here look like humans, like you and me. But they have powers. Powers that are unusual. When we think of a supernatural power, we think about flying, shooting lasers out of our eyes, or reading minds. No dear reader. I'm not talking about those powers. These powers that these people hold dear is not supernatural. It is worse. They have the power to hurt or help. No, these people aren't dictators, theyre not gods. Though, they could be if they tried. So here am I, walking alone in the night, in an unknown world, with people who have the power to destroy or create.Also, one more thing. It is always nighttime here. No daylight. But you can see very clearly in the dark. It is as if you dont need light. So where am I? Dear reader, like I said before, I do not know. I only know I am a mere human in a world of monsters.Before I continue, I must tell you how I ended up in this cold dark world. It started off as a bad day. I got up, bumped my toe on the bed, screamed in pain. Limped to the bathroom to brush my teeth, only to realize I had no toothbrush because I was poor. Damn you rich folks! So, in pain and frustration, I got dressed, walked out of the little shabby home, and bumped into a police men. You see, in my country, politicians are very corrupt. So I got a fine for bumping into a police man. How ridiculous. I went to work late as usual. My boss got tired of me getting late so he fired me that day. Now jobless, going to be homeless, I decided that my life isn't worth it. I got a rope, tied it to a lamppost and my neck. And I jumped. And my body dangling like a door bell, it was a funny sight... wait.. I could see my body?Here, with my consciousness, I see myself dangling like some ornament for Christmas. Was I dead? If I was, I should've done this long time ago. It didn't hurt a bit. While I was enjoying my new freedom, it happened. Yes, dear reader, it happened. The moment where you fall into heaven or hell depending on whether you were a good use in the physical world or not. But I did not land on any of those places. Instead, I landed in an unknown world, dark, cold, and steady eyes staring at me. Dear reader, if I had a physical body, I might have pissed myself.The landing didn't hurt one bit. More of a feeling of landing on fluffy clouds. Not that I know how clouds feel like, I'm just assuming. The atmosphere was very cold and the setting was very dark. But my eyes adjusted very quick and it was as if I didn't need any lights. And that's when I saw them. Those vile creatures. Dear reader, remember when I told you that they have the power to destroy or create? Those creatures destroyed me. Destroyed me without hesitation. Not destroyed me as in killing me, for I was already dead. But my heart felt like it would explode, and my mind fried. When I looked closely, I realized.. these creatures... these creatures looked just like me!\"Wha..what\" I cried. Not only they looked like me, they had different expressions. And even though they looked human, they had wings. I cannot explain the characteristics of the wing because I dont think there is a word for it. I could point out several of their expressions. Such as anger, disgust, joy, sadness, and shock. Thats when it came to me. These creatures were my emotions. But you may ask, \"if theyre just emotions, how can they destroy or create?\" Dear reader, I am very glad that you asked. I said destroy because there were emotions that horrified me such as greed, lust, envy, indignation, and shame. Those feelings and emotions destroyed me because of those, I had lost my wife, my kids, and my friends. But what use are those when I'm dead, eh? But other emotions such as joy, trust, kindness, pity, calmness, and interest built me up. Those emotions helped me become a better man.But one emotion cannot mix with another. You can be happy, but you cannot be sad at the same time. There is no way. Nada. So it was natural for these human like figures to fight. But it was not only a fight in the outside, but in the inside as well. I faced constant battles of pain and suffering inside me, for they were my emotions and thoughts. This is why, dear reader, that I said they can destroy. And this battle happens quite often. I am writing this as fast as I can before they quarrel with each other again. But, they also create. I have created a sense of knowledge and common sense that some of the negativity emotions started to disappear. Yes, my mission was to get rid of the negative and hurtful thoughts and emotions. So there is a time of peace for some time and a time of war at others. But it is much better than when I arrived. There is no clock or calendar here in this dark world. So I cannot tell you how many days, months, or years have passed. But if I was to guess, I have passed around 50 birthdays. But I dont feel old or young.I know most of you readers will not believe in me. How can one fall into a pit of darkness? How can one see their inner demons? That my reader, you must find out by yourself. \"You want us to kill ourselves?\" Noooo... I do not mean that dear reader. I mean find out till you die or something. I do not wish you to kill yourself. Very tragic. I did it because well, there is no good reason. I have destroyed about 80% of the negative emotions by now. Less wars in me. I have found peace at some time. I still tend to get out of here. In a sense, I am an outsider. These creatures look like me, but they are different than me. I am one, they are many. I must adapt to this place which I have difficult doing. Once in a while, I do see a glimpse of light. Maybe there is a way to escape this hellish place. I am tired of groaning in pain and then feeling good in a spilt second. It is very tiring. I have tried to make peace with these creatures, but they dont like each other. So Im stuck with them for the rest of eternity.I have spent roughly 1000+ centuries in this place. I can see the light very clearly now. It is still out of reach. While I have found peace with these creatures, I will escape the very chance I have. This is my story readers. Wish me luck.",

          "context": "That was my honest answer to its question.  Yawning my thoughts out, I opened my eyes and saw how bright the forest today. I quickly bent my upper body upwards and jumped out of Mister C. Gigantifolia's huge leaf. I am not a human but I have a God-given body like a human. I don't have a name when I was brought to the Earth but my fellow earthlings call me by Spring. And when I said 'my fellow earthlings', I mean the endangered creatures inhabiting the small area of the Earth, where the green dancers are tall, colorful flowers are blooming, and the heat of the sun is alive as the winter season passed by. \"Good morning, everyone!\" I greeted and lifted my head when a peeking ray of the sun hit my face and made me look at the swaying trees above me, \"Sway it, green dancers!\" I am the guardian of nature's life and I am gifted and these gifts mustn't be abused. \"Good morning, Spring!\" they greeted back harmoniously at me that made my cheeks bulged out from happiness. I was given a gift of communication, I can talk with the woodland creatures and understand them. My other gift is my wings, I can fly above the skies and look at the entire form of Earth. The last and greatest gift, I am invisible to humans' senses so that they can't harm me. I looked around the forest and saw the blossomed flowers, healthy animals, strong trees, and aliveness of the other creatures living with me in the forest.  I whispered inside my mind. Their life is my happiness. And whenever I am happy because of these creatures, I remember the only creature who makes my face frown. They said it is silent but still alive as it brings light to the world. \"Good morning, Sun! Did Moon angered you?\" I joked and let out a faint giggle. The usual answer  silence. It was only silence, a long and agonizing silence, while the wind kept blowing across my ears and touching my naked skin. \"Just let her shine, Spring,\" Floreta advised in her tiny voice. \"I know Floreta but...\" I crouched and crossed my arms on top of my knees then buried my chin on top of my left wrist, I sighed before continuing, \"It's been a hundred silent years, no words... how can I protect all of you if Sun won't talk to me anymore?\" \"Protect us from what, missy?\" Passiflora whispered. My heavy eyelids dropped and my smile vanished as I mention their name, \"Humans.\" \"Oh, dewdrop, you are always protecting us,\" Passiflora reminded. \"But it is not enough. When I flew above the sky, all I see is them! Shaving half of the forest, burning innocent creatures, and ruling the world as if they own it!\" \"Calm down, Spring...\" Floreta told me. \"Humans are bound to be our greatest enemies, we can't alter that...\" Kapok tree expressed in a thick and low voice. \"But not all of them, Mister Kapok...\" Yellow Orchid, with her gentle attitude, opposed Kapok's bitter statement. \"Hmmm... Just like how the summer season is destined to come after this spring season and then winter will be back again...\" Miss Brocket joined in the conversation. \"Until we will blossom on spring season... again and again...\" Passiflora added. \"It's stinging my heart, seeing the Earth that was once green and full of nature's life will soon disperse from my sight.\" \"We won't disperse, Spring, humans still need us...\" Floreta countered. \"And we need humans!\" Yellow Orchid exclaimed which made me smile for a while. \"See, we are not scared if our life will soon be taken because if it's fated to be then ready we must be.\" Every creature agreed to Passiflora's statement and whispered their brave spirits. \"When you took your first steps on Earth, you are fated to be our guardian but you are not a wizard, Spring. You can't magic our fates and your fate.\" I laid my back upon the dirt and placed my right hand beneath my head. If only I can find a way to connect to the Sun again. I raised my left hand and tried to reach for the sun while staring straight at it. If only I could reach you again and you can tell me what I must do... \"I know what to do! I will fly and talk to the Sun again.\" \"You can't fly that high, Spring.\" \"It's too dangerous.\" They contradicted and voice out their opposition. \"Please, I must try...\" All of them left me with silence as their answer. I flapped my wings and it slowly lifted my feet away from the ground. \"This is our last hope...\" I whispered and flew away from the forest. Dashing through the sky, breaking the wind's current as I tried to get out of the Earth's atmosphere. I haven't tried this but don't know what could go wrong. I slowed down to avoid burning my wings and tried to adjust my movements. \"Sun...\" I whispered when I saw the burning sphere. I went near Venus and tried to talk to the Sun. \"Sun? Are you there?\" I asked and waited for an answer. But all I heard is an indistinct and faint voice, it was almost as faint as the wind on Earth. I went near Mercury and felt the warmth of the Sun. \"Do you still remember me? I am the guardian of nature's life on Earth and I need to know what I must do to protect them.\"  \"I'm sorry, I can't hear you, Sun...\"  When I finally heard it, it made me ask, \"Why?\"  \"They did this to Earth, why would I look at them?\" I exclaimed with pure hatred. No answer. The Sun is silent again. I took the Sun's advice and went back to the Earth. I flew down to the skies and I leveled my gaze to a newborn human.  The Sun's words repeated inside my head. \"A seed and a flower,\" I whispered. I stood in front of a man talking to a black rectangular shape creature, they call it a cellphone. I leveled my gaze to his and saw a huge tree with growing fruits. An elderly woman walked past me and I followed her, trying to level my gaze upon her weak eyes. I saw a leafless tree. \"What does this mean, Sun?\"  \"I don't believe they will, Sun... I have observed them... Cruel --\"  I waited for the Sun to continue and watched as these humans walk around the solid surface.  I closed my eyes and whispered to the wind, \"Humans, you must fly down from the skies, level your gazes with them... and tell me what you can see in their eyes.\"    I saw a flying leaf and petals that whirled above my head. I followed where it came from and saw the half of my body turning into petals and leaves. \"I am scared. What if...\"  \"I do,\" the wind carried my dispersing body and whispered my last words, \"Fly down from your sky, level your gaze with each other...\" I looked up and all that is left to me is my left eye letting out one tear. \"...And tell me what you can see in their eyes...\"",

          "context": "It all began in Pirate elf street. The day before Christmas, I and my family travelled to Canada to see my mother's grandma. We boarded a plane tho.Ohhh i forgot! My name is Cee Jim and I'm sixteen years of age.I kinda believe in goblets, spells and magic. I am the only child of my parents. I am loved by everyone i know and came across. My favourite TV program is F.r.i.e.n.d.s and my favourite actress from the program is Jennifer Aniston also known as Rachel Green in the movie. I prefer cats to dogs, yeah yeah. I am done with college.Alllllllright peeps....Back to the story...my great grandma's house is A to the MA to the ZING- Amazing!!It was time for dinner. My mom served us, we gave thanks to God Almighty and focused on our meals. There was this cold stare that my great grandma gave me....more like I WILL POSSESS YOU stare.After the heavy meal, i headed up to my bedroom. Mehn! I was stuffed. I could not even breathe.I also could not touch my toes or maybe see my toes just like PO in KUNG FU PANDA...hahahaAs i opened the door of my bedroom, I felt something strange watching me.Could it be Santa Claus or maybe the weird old great grandmother of Cee Jim?I asked myselfI quickly entered my room and shut the door. I lay on my bed thinking about what I experienced right now. I tried my best to tell my mom but i couldn't move. There i was in my bed....FROZEN just like Anna of Arendelle in the movie, Frozen!! Fortunately enough for me, i slept off.....do not ask me how cause it felt magical.The Following day(Christmas), my dad woke me up so earlyyyyyyy. He told me to prepare for Church. I quickly took my shower. I was about putting on my clothes when i saw a strange ring on my bed. The ring was made of gold, shun like the morning sun and looked magical. Out of curiosity, i quickly put it on and it vanished leaving a mark 'C' on my pinky finger. I was shocked to my bones but still brushed it aside as nothing.As i headed downstairs to the living room, my great grandma held the same pinky finger and chanted:RingRingRing of powerGrant her wishesSo so soMote moteIt be.I nearly passed out as she said those words. I wanted to speak but i couldn't. I wanted to shout but i held something seizing my voice. I then knew that my great grandma had bewitched me. I couldn't reason well again.I cried out so loud but no one could hear me only the witch could. I wished her death and so it was. She was buried that day. Her last words were ONLY YOU. I was sad yet happy. I thought i was free.At the Church, a black mass was conducted. I said to myself......so G.granny was a witch.....because how can the Reverend conduct a black mass for her. I don't really know about G.granny's own culture but just a Black mass was conducted. During the mass, i heard voices screaming, some were echoing. I told my mom I was scared. She did nothing but held my hand tight. It seemed that G.granny's spirit was floating because I do not know what could make anyone that scared.That day, Christmas was horrible.Weeks passed by and none of my friends came close to me. They avoided because of whatever their reason might be. My mom also began to fear me cause sometimes i would either laugh or look like my late G.granny.My mom knew that my G.granny was a witch all along and she never cared to tell me. I was all alone in this hugeeeeeeee world of theirs.I was a living soul in the land of the dead or better still, a dead soul moving in the human world.I do not know the perfect word to but just know that i was just moving. It was as if i was being pushed. Something was pushing me. I could not stop marching to my doom...I was scared to death but none of these seemed to bother anyone.Once if i could remember, a lady in white called me and told me to break my finger to be free. I thought she was nuts so i didn't adhere to that. I could not even see her face. I just heard her melodious voice and knew that she was a female with a beautiful white gown. It seemed soo light, light like a feather or a piece of paper.The other time a butterfly whispered into my ears saying...BreakRingBE FREEI still did not listen. Like who listens to a butterfly or should I say a fly made of butterEven if i listened to it, how will i break my fingerWish for it? Nah.....bad idea.That would bring a curse on me and maybe my entire generation.Better i ignore the god damn warning.I tried my best to speak but no one cared to listen. I wanted to tell my mom but i scared of what she will do to me. You dare not tell my mom nonsense.Waking up everyday made no sense to me. I was tired, frustrated and worst of all...ANGRY.My dad was great but I could not just tell him. I feared for his safety. I was threat to my parents, not only my parents to my friends, relatives and everyone in pirate elf street.Was i a blessing or a curse, definitely a curse. How could i do this to myself. Why the hell did i put on the ring. I should have alerted my parents! Gosh i am so dooooomed for life.One dreadful night, i wished for the ring to take all my problems away. Suddenly everyone on Earth vanished(died) leaving only me behind.I was so happy till I heard a knock on my door.....",

          "context": "John lived with his wife Ema and pet dog Bruno. They were both very helpful and good at heart. All the neighbours loved and respected them. Bruno was the only companion they had , their children having moved to seek their own destinies. Bruno was a cute little dog with silken brown coat .One day the couple was playing in their garden with Bruno. Suddenly , Bruno sniffed hard and began to bark loudly. He ran to a spot under the oak tree and began circling it ,jumping and wagging his tail vigorously.\" What's the matter Bruno? Why are you behaving like this?\" asked John , pulling him by his leash . Bruno dug the spot with his paws and sniffed hard. He pulled out something . Picking it up in his mouth , Bruno ran towardsEma . Shebend down to see what Bruno was holding in his mouth. She gave out a loud shriek holding up a diamond necklace. \" Look John, what Bruno has found . \"\" Isn't it the same necklace your father mentioned in the diary \" , asked Ema .\" Yes it's the same one \", replied John. \" He has also mentioned about a chest of coins . We need to find that too \" . The couple dug up the spot and found the treasury. They brought it inside and kept the chest of coins safely in the cupboard.        Ema took out her father in law'sred diary . In neat handwriting he had written a note for them ,' I have kept box of gold coins and a necklace under the oak tree . They are our family heirloom. Now that I am going ,I want to pass  it on to .you. \"\" I just can't believe my luck \" said Peter. \" Why don't you sell these off and pay the debts\" suggested Ema . A few days later John went to his neighbour,Peter , who was a jeweller . \" Peter , I wish to sell this off . Please help me . \"Peter looked at the necklace . \" He must have stolen this and now wants to sell it off to avoid suspicion\" Peter thought.\" This is a beautiful piece . From where did you get it ?\" asked Peter.\" It's my family heirloom. But I have to sell it to pay off my debts \" sighed John sadly.\" I will let you know about it\" said Peter examining the jewelry and the coins .\" Shall I come back tomorrow?\"asked John.\" Yes .\"Bruno yelped as Peter patted his head \"Why do you always snap at me dear ?\"Bruno glared at Peter as he followed John out of the shop .Peter had a bad reputation of telling lies and cheating . His business was falling because of this. But he somehow managed to convince his customers that he was innocent and all that they had heard were alleged rumours.Next day , while John and Ema were having tea , there was a knock on the door. Bruno jumped out of his bed and ran towards the door. John opened the door and found Peter standing . John and Ema welcomed him warmly . Ema offered him coffee and cakes . Bruno began to bark loudly.\" Don't be naughty , Bruno . Go and lie down\" ordered peter .Bruno snarled at Peter and lay down on the carpet .\" John , I am sorry to say that this necklace is fake. It's just ordinary stones , not precious gems as you claim . Even the coins are nothing but painted pieces of metal. \"\" What rubbish are you saying. You are joking.\"Ema looked at the necklace and coins with disbelieving eyes.\" I don't believe you, Peter . I know very well that the jewelry and coins weren't fake . The necklace was studded with real diamonds , rubies and emeralds . Even the coins were pure gold ,\" shrieked Ema.\" Believe me ma'am , I am not lying \" ,said Peter holding her hands.Ema was sobbing uncontrollably now .Peter took leave of the shocked and shaken couple and left.On reaching home , Peter hugged his wife, Annie excitedly, \" I have done as you had told me to do. I have managed to convince the couple that the jewelry and the coins were just ordinary stuff.\"Annie took out the necklace and the coins from the drawer and clung it close to her chest .\" This is mine now .\"\" You look beautiful Annie.\"That night, John and Ema could not sleep .\" I still don't understand how dad could do this to me\" said Peter .\" Nor do I \" replied Ema .Next day early morning, Peter and Ema went to Peter's house. Peter and Annie were having tea in the living room. Their pet parrot, Myra was perched on the window sill. Bruno snarled and jumped at Myra . She dodged and flew and sat on John's shoulder and whispered something. \" What..... what are you saying \" shouted John . Everyone looked at him .\" What's the matter , John? \" asked Peter.\" Myra is saying something . Myra can you please repeat what you told me \"said John.\"I could not hear you properly.\"\" Let us cheat John and Ema\" repeated Myra.\"What nonsense are you saying\"snorted Peter.\" Shut up,Myra. \" squealed Annie , her face white .\" We will remove the real gems and replace themwith stones \" chirped Myra .Peter ran after Myra with the kitchen knife . Myra flew out of the door with a ferociously barking Bruno behind her .Hearing the mayhem , the neighbours came out of their houses . Peter and John were now shouting on top of their voices.\" You have cheated me . You told me a lie \" screamed John .\" Won't I look beautiful . No one will come to know we have cheated \" sang Myra , hovering over Annie .\" How dare you say that \" Annie howled.\" So  you both  tried to con this innocent couple\" said Erik . \"Your own parrot has spilt the beans . She has repeated Your conversation. As You sow , so shall you reap . You need to apologise and return all the stolen things.\"\" Please forgive us\" begged Peter and Annie , returning all the stolen stuff . \"Greed had blinded us .\"",
