I can promise you a good time if you do.\"The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help.The Frog had a plan. He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him.The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg. Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner.Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit.",

Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.\"Spare me!\" begged the poor Mouse. \"Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you.\"The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.\"You laughed when I said I would repay you,\" said the Mouse. \"Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.\"A kindness is never wasted.",

A Jackdaw saw the deed, and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling of feathers and a fierce air, he came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram. But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed he was there.The Shepherd saw the fluttering Jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened. Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children.\"What a funny bird this is!\" they said laughing, \"what do you call it, father?\"\"That is a Jackdaw, my children. But if you should ask him, he would say he is an Eagle.\"Do not let your vanity make you overestimate your powers.",

If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure.\"The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass.\"I made him promise not to hurt us,\" said the Fox. \"But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone.\"So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit.

In every battle the Weasels carried off the victory, as well as a large number of the Mice, which they ate for dinner next day. In despair the Mice called a council, and there it was decided that the Mouse army was always beaten because it had no leaders. So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent Mice.To distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks, the new leaders proudly bound on their heads lofty crests and ornaments of feathers or straw. Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all the arts of war, they sent a challenge to the Weasels.The Weasels accepted the challenge with eagerness, for they were always ready for a fight when a meal was in sight. They immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers. Soon the Mouse line gave way before the attack and the whole army fled for cover. The privates easily slipped into their holes, but the Mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of their head-dresses. Not one escaped the teeth of the hungry Weasels.Greatness has its penalties.",

But the Dolphins took the shipwrecked people on their backs and swam with them to shore.Now it was the custom among the Greeks to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage. So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water, he thought it was a man, and made the Monkey climb up on his back. Then off he swam with him toward the shore.The Monkey sat up, grave and dignified, on the Dolphin's back.\"You are a citizen of illustrious Athens, are you not?\" asked the Dolphin politely.\"Yes,\" answered the Monkey, proudly. \"My family is one of the noblest in the city.\"\"Indeed,\" said the Dolphin. \"Then of course you often visit Piraeus.\"\"Yes, yes,\" replied the Monkey. \"Indeed, I do. I am with him constantly. Piraeus is my very best friend.\"This answer took the Dolphin by surprise, and, turning his head, he now saw what it was he was carrying. Without more ado, he dived and left the foolish Monkey to take care of himself, while he swam off in search of some human being to save.One falsehood leads to another.",

Thus it happened that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool.The Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had not money enough to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. The Woodman told what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury dived into the pool. When he came up again he held a wonderful golden axe.\"Is this your axe?\" Mercury asked the Woodman.\"No,\" answered the honest Woodman, \"that is not my axe.\"Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool. This time he brought up an axe of silver, but the Woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a wooden handle.Mercury dived down for the third time, and when he came up again he had the very axe that had been lost.The poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank the kind god enough. Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman's honesty.\"I admire your honesty,\" he said, \"and as a reward you may have all three axes, the gold and the silver as well as your own.\"The happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures, and soon the story of his good fortune was known to everybody in the village. Now there were several Woodmen in the village who believed that they could easily win the same good fortune. They hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding their axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost them. Then they wept and wailed and called on Mercury to help them.And indeed, Mercury did appear, first to this one, then to that. To each one he showed an axe of gold, and each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury did not give them the golden axe. Oh no! Instead he gave them each a hard whack over the head with it and sent them home. And when they returned next day to look for their own axes, they were nowhere to be found.Honesty is the best policy.",

Far into the sky he soared trying to shake off his enemy. But the Serpent's hold only tightened, and slowly the Eagle sank back to earth, gasping for breath.A Countryman chanced to see the unequal combat. In pity for the noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the coiling Serpent and freed the Eagle.The Serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchful Countryman. Instead he struck at the drinking horn, hanging at the Countryman's belt, and into it let fly the poison of his fangs.The Countryman now went on toward home. Becoming thirsty on the way, he filled his horn at a spring, and was about to drink. There was a sudden rush of great wings. Sweeping down, the Eagle seized the poisoned horn from out his savior's hands, and flew away with it to hide it where it could never be found.An act of kindness is well repaid.",

The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning. In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet. There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses, indeed, the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine. But just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door. In great fear the Mice scurried to a hiding place, where they lay quite still for a long time, hardly daring to breathe. When at last they ventured back to the feast, the door opened suddenly and in came the servants to clear the table, followed by the House Dog.The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.\"You may have luxuries and dainties that I have not,\" she said as she hurried away, \"but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it.\"Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty.",

At last a very young Mouse got up and said:\"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\"All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:\"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?\"It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it.",

Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird \"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo\" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window.\"Get away from here, sir,\" she said to the Grasshopper. \"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\"But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him.\"Well sir,\" she said, \"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\"The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up.Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.",

Instead, not long afterward, he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn. The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set, and the Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell. But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck. The Stork could easily get at the food with his long bill, but all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar, and sniff at the delicious odor. And when the Fox lost his temper, the Stork said calmly:Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself.",

But he had a queer, fluttery feeling inside him, for, you know, he was very much afraid of the Fox.\"Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever. Just think of it! I simply cannot wait to embrace you! Do come down, dear friend, and let us celebrate the joyful event.\"\"How grand!\" said the Cock. \"I certainly am delighted at the news.\" But he spoke in an absent way, and stretching up on tiptoes, seemed to be looking at something afar off.\"What is it you see?\" asked the Fox a little anxiously.\"Why, it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way. They must have heard the good news and\"But the Fox did not wait to hear more. Off he started on a run.\"Wait,\" cried the Cock. \"Why do you run? The Dogs are friends of yours now!\"\"Yes,\" answered the Fox. \"But they might not have heard the news. Besides, I have a very important errand that I had almost forgotten about.\"The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep, for he had succeeded in outwitting a very crafty enemy.The trickster is easily tricked.",

What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.\"No need to search any farther,\" thought sly Master Fox. \"Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast.\"Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, \"Good-morning, beautiful creature!\"The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting.\"What a charming creature she is!\" said the Fox. \"How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds.\"Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds.So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth.\"Thank you,\" said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. \"Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?\"The flatterer lives at the expense of those who will listen to him.",

They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along.One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.\"We can help you to see the world,\" said the Ducks. \"Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry.\"The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds.Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried:\"This must surely be the King of Tortoises!\"\"Why certainly\" began the Tortoise.But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.",

So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!The Kid knew there was little hope for him.\"Please, Mr. Wolf,\" he said trembling, \"I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.\"The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.Do not let anything turn you from your purpose\n.",

So they sent a petition to Jupiter asking for a king.Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The Frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how tame and peaceable King Log was. In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older Frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government.To teach the Frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a Crane to be king of Frogland. The Crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old King Log. He gobbled up the poor Frogs right and left and they soon saw what fools they had been. In mournful croaks they begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they should all be destroyed.\"How now!\" cried Jupiter \"Are you not yet content? You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes.\"Be sure you can better your condition before you seek to change.",

The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.Next year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.Now the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause.

So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably.With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely:\"A hearty welcome to our woods, honored sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here. I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends.\"\"I feel highly flattered, kind sir,\" replied the Cock slyly. \"If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in.\"The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin.",

He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four hours.The command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful Lion.And when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized him.\"Goodby, neighbor Cricket,\" he called. \"I'm off. He will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say.\"Do not give your enemies the slightest reason to attack your reputation. Your enemies will seize any excuse to attack you.",
