The Ass & the Lap Dog,"There was once an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. This Dog was a favorite and received many a pat and kind word from his Master, as well as choice bits from his plate. Every day the Dog would run to meet the Master, frisking playfully about and leaping up to lick his hands and face.All this the Ass saw with much discontent. Though he was well fed, he had much work to do; besides, the Master hardly ever took any notice of him.Now the jealous Ass got it into his silly head that all he had to do to win his Master's favor was to act like the Dog. So one day he left his stable and clattered eagerly into the house.Finding his Master seated at the dinner table, he kicked up his heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily around the table, upsetting it as he did so. Then he planted his forefeet on his Master's knees and rolled out his tongue to lick the Master's face, as he had seen the Dog do. But his weight upset the chair, and Ass and man rolled over together in the pile of broken dishes from the table.The Master was much alarmed at the strange behavior of the Ass, and calling for help, soon attracted the attention of the servants. When they saw the danger the Master was in from the clumsy beast, they set upon the Ass and drove him with kicks and blows back to the stable. There they left him to mourn the foolishness that had brought him nothing but a sound beating.Behavior that is regarded as agreeable in one is very rude and impertinent in another.

The Old Lion & the Fox,"An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his younger days, pretended that he was sick. He took care to let all his neighbors know about it, and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors. And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by one.The Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the Lion's health. The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation.""I should be glad to do as you ask,"" he added, ""but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and none coming out. Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their way out again?""Take warning from the misfortunes of others.",Take warning from the misfortunes of others.
The Milkmaid & Her Pail,"A Milkmaid had been out to milk the cows and was returning from the field with the shining milk pail balanced nicely on her head. As she walked along, her pretty head was busy with plans for the days to come.""This good, rich milk,"" she mused, ""will give me plenty of cream to churn. The butter I make I will take to market, and with the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching. How nice it will be when they are all hatched and the yard is full of fine young chicks. Then when May day comes I will sell them, and with the money I'll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair. All the young men will look at me. They will come and try to make love to me,but I shall very quickly send them about their business!""As she thought of how she would settle that matter, she tossed her head scornfully, and down fell the pail of milk to the ground. And all the milk flowed out, and with it vanished butter and eggs and chicks and new dress and all the milkmaid's pride.Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.",Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.
The Goatherd & the Goat,"A Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover. The Goatherd tried to call it back, but in vain. It would not obey him. Then he picked up a stone and threw it, breaking the Goat's horn.The Goatherd was frightened.""Do not tell the master,"" he begged the Goat.""No,"" said the Goat, ""that broken horn can speak for itself!""Wicked deeds will not stay hid.",Wicked deeds will not stay hid.
The Wolf & the Shepherd,"A Wolf, lurking near the Shepherd's hut, saw the Shepherd and his family feasting on a roasted lamb.""Aha!"" he muttered.

The Man & the Lion,"A Lion and a Man chanced to travel in company through the forest. They soon began to quarrel, for each of them boasted that he and his kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind.Now they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a statue. It was a representation of Heracles in the act of tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion.""See,"" said the man, ""that's how strong we are! The King of Beasts is like wax in our hands!""""Ho!"" laughed the Lion, ""a Man made that statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made it!""It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story.","It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story."
The Miser,"A Miser had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden. Every day he went to the spot, dug up the treasure and counted it piece by piece to make sure it was all there. He made so many trips that a Thief, who had been observing him, guessed what it was the Miser had hidden, and one night quietly dug up the treasure and made off with it.When the Miser discovered his loss, he was overcome with grief and despair. He groaned and cried and tore his hair.A passerby heard his cries and asked what had happened.""My gold! O my gold!"" cried the Miser, wildly, ""someone has robbed me!""""Your gold! There in that hole? Why did you put it there? Why did you not keep it in the house where you could easily get it when you had to buy things?""""Buy!"" screamed the Miser angrily. ""Why, I never touched the gold. I couldn't think of spending any of it.""The stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole.""If that is the case,"" he said, ""cover up that stone. It is worth just as much to you as the treasure you lost!""A possession is worth no more than the use we make of it.",A possession is worth no more than the use we make of it.
The Fox Without a Tail,"A Fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after much painful tugging, in getting away. But he had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him.For a long time he kept away from the other Foxes, for he knew well enough that they would all make fun of him and crack jokes and laugh behind his back. But it was hard for him to live alone, and at last he thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out of his trouble.He called a meeting of all the Foxes, saying that he had something of great importance to tell the tribe.When they were all gathered together, the Fox Without a Tail got up and made a long speech about those Foxes who had come to harm because of their tails.This one had been caught by hounds when his tail had become entangled in the hedge. That one had not been able to run fast enough because of the weight of his brush. Besides, it was well known, he said, that men hunt Foxes simply for their tails, which they cut off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the danger and uselessness of having a tail, said Master Fox, he would advise every Fox to cut it off, if he valued life and safety.When he had finished talking, an old Fox arose, and said, smiling:""Master Fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have your answer.""When the poor Fox Without a Tail turned around, there arose such a storm of jeers and hooting, that he saw how useless it was to try any longer to persuade the Foxes to part with their tails.Do not listen to the advice of him who seeks to lower you to his own level.",Do not listen to the advice of him who seeks to lower you to his own level.

""Let me drive the flies away,"" he said kindly.""No, no!"" exclaimed the Fox, ""do not disturb them! They have taken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left.""Better to bear a lesser evil than to risk a greater in removing it.",Better to bear a lesser evil than to risk a greater in removing it.
The Mischievous Dog,"There was once a Dog who was so ill-natured and mischievous that his Master had to fasten a heavy wooden clog about his neck to keep him from annoying visitors and neighbors. But the Dog seemed to be very proud of the clog and dragged it about noisily as if he wished to attract everybody's attention. He was not able to impress anyone.""You would be wiser,"" said an old acquaintance, ""to keep quietly out of sight with that clog. Do you want everybody to know what a disgraceful and ill-natured Dog you are?""Notoriety is not fame.",Notoriety is not fame.
The Wolf & the House Dog,"There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful. He was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it.One night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fine appearance.""You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to,"" replied the Dog. ""Leave the woods; there you live miserably. Why, you have to fight hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will get along beautifully.""""What must I do?"" asked the Wolf.""Hardly anything,"" answered the House Dog. ""Chase people who carry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on the people of the house. In return you will get tidbits of every kind, chicken bones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside, not to speak of kind words and caresses.""The Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost wept. But just then he noticed that the hair on the Dog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed.""What is that on your neck?""""Nothing at all,"" replied the Dog.""What! nothing!""""Oh, just a trifle!""""But please tell me.""""Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened.""""What! A chain!"" cried the Wolf. ""Don't you go wherever you please?""""Not always! But what's the difference?"" replied the Dog.""All the difference in the world! I don't care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price."" And away ran the Wolf to the woods.There is nothing worth so much as liberty.",There is nothing worth so much as liberty.
The Bat & the Weasels,"A Bat blundered into the nest of a Weasel, who ran up to catch and eat him. The Bat begged for his life, but the Weasel would not listen.""You are a Mouse,"" he said, ""and I am a sworn enemy of Mice. Every Mouse I catch, I am going to eat!""""But I am not a Mouse!"" cried the Bat. ""Look at my wings. Can Mice fly? Why, I am only a Bird! Please let me go!""The Weasel had to admit that the Bat was not a Mouse, so he let him go. But a few days later, the foolish Bat went blindly into the nest of another Weasel. This Weasel happened to be a bitter enemy of Birds, and he soon had the Bat under his claws, ready to eat him.""You are a Bird,"" he said, ""and I am going to eat you!""""What,"" cried the Bat, ""I, a Bird! Why, all Birds have feathers! I am nothing but a Mouse.

The Quack Toad,"An old Toad once informed all his neighbors that he was a learned doctor. In fact he could cure anything. The Fox heard the news and hurried to see the Toad. He looked the Toad over very carefully.""Mr. Toad,"" he said, ""I've been told that you cure anything! But just take a look at yourself, and then try some of your own medicine. If you can cure yourself of that blotchy skin and that rheumatic gait, someone might believe you. Otherwise, I should advise you to try some other profession.""Those who would mend others, should first mend themselves.","Those who would mend others, should first mend themselves."
The Rose & the Butterfly,"A Butterfly once fell in love with a beautiful Rose. The Rose was not indifferent, for the Butterfly's wings were powdered in a charming pattern of gold and silver. And so, when he fluttered near and told how he loved her, she blushed rosily and said yes. After much pretty love-making and many whispered vows of constancy, the Butterfly took a tender leave of his sweetheart.But alas! It was a long time before he came back to her.""Is this your constancy?"" she exclaimed tearfully. ""It is ages since you went away, and all the time, you have been carrying on with all sorts of flowers. I saw you kiss Miss Geranium, and you fluttered around Miss Mignonette until Honey Bee chased you away. I wish he had stung you!""""Constancy!"" laughed the Butterfly. ""I had no sooner left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you. You carried on scandalously with Mr. Bumble Bee and you made eyes at every single Bug you could see. You can't expect any constancy from me!""Do not expect constancy in others if you have none yourself.",Do not expect constancy in others if you have none yourself.
The Cat & the Fox,"Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the waya stray mouse here, a fat chicken therethey began an argument to while away the time between bites. And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal.""You think you are extremely clever, don't you?"" said the Fox. ""Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks!""""Well,"" retorted the Cat, ""I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!""Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves.""This is my trick,"" he called to the Fox. ""Now let me see what yours are worth.""But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first. He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows,but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks.Common sense is always worth more than cunning.",Common sense is always worth more than cunning.
Two Travelers & a Bear,"Two Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near them.One of the Men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree.The other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw himself on the ground and lay still, as if he were dead. He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead body.It must have been true, for the Bear snuffed at the Man's head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied that he was dead, walked away.The Man in the tree climbed down.""It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear,"" he said. ""What did he tell you?""""He said,"" answered the other, ""that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in a moment of danger.""Misfortune is the test of true friendship.",Misfortune is the test of true friendship.

He asked them to let him share the cave with them, and the Snakes kindly consented.The Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay. His sharp quills pricked them at every turn, and at last they politely asked him to leave.""I am very well satisfied, thank you,"" said the Porcupine. ""I intend to stay right here.""

The Fox & the Monkey,"At a great meeting of the Animals, who had gathered to elect a new ruler, the Monkey was asked to dance. This he did so well, with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the Animals were carried entirely off their feet with enthusiasm, and then and there, elected him their king.The Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted with the Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler.One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying to King Monkey, he told him he had found a rich treasure, which he had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the Monkey.The greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap. As soon as he saw the meat he grasped eagerly for it, only to find himself held fast in the trap. The Fox stood off and laughed.""You pretend to be our king,"" he said, ""and cannot even take care of yourself!""Shortly after that, another election among the Animals was held.The true leader proves himself by his qualities.",The true leader proves himself by his qualities.

The Flies & the Honey,"A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on the table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an invitation. No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, to gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.Be not greedy for a little passing pleasure.

The Fox & the Pheasants,"One moonlight evening as Master Fox was taking his usual stroll in the woods, he saw a number of Pheasants perched quite out of his reach on a limb of a tall old tree. The sly Fox soon found a bright patch of moonlight, where the Pheasants could see him clearly; there he raised himself up on his hind legs, and began a wild dance. First he whirled 'round and 'round like a top, then he hopped up and down, cutting all sorts of strange capers. The Pheasants stared giddily. They hardly dared blink for fear of losing him out of their sight a single instant.Now the Fox made as if to climb a tree, now he fell over and lay still, playing dead, and the next instant he was hopping on all fours, his back in the air, and his bushy tail shaking so that it seemed to throw out silver sparks in the moonlight.By this time the poor birds' heads were in a whirl. And when the Fox began his performance all over again, so dazed did they become, that they lost their hold on the limb, and fell down one by one to the Fox.Too much attention to danger may cause us to fall victims to it.",Too much attention to danger may cause us to fall victims to it.
The Eagle & the Kite,"An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak. She seemed very sad and drooping for an Eagle.

""That would be a very simple matter. I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather!""The Eagle accepted the Kite immediately. But after the wedding, when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride, all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.""Is that the Ostrich you talked about?"" said the Eagle in disgust.""To win you I would have said and promised anything,"" replied the Kite.Everything is fair in love.",Everything is fair in love.
"The Stag, the Sheep, & the Wolf","One day a Stag came to a Sheep and asked her to lend him a measure of wheat. The Sheep knew him for a very swift runner, who could easily take himself out of reach, were he so inclined. So she asked him if he knew someone who would answer for him.""Yes, yes,"" answered the Stag confidently, ""the Wolf has promised to be my surety.""""The Wolf!"" exclaimed the Sheep indignantly. ""Do you think I would trust you on such security? I know the Wolf! He takes what he wants and runs off with it without paying.

The Animals & the Plague,"Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals. Many died, and those who lived were so ill, that they cared for neither food nor drink, and dragged themselves about listlessly. No longer could a fat young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner, nor a tender lamb rouse greedy Sir Wolf's appetite.At last the Lion decided to call a council. When all the animals were gathered together he arose and said:""Dear friends, I believe the gods have sent this plague upon us as a punishment for our sins. Therefore, the most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice. Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all.""I will confess all my sins first. I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep. They had done me no harm. I have eaten goats and bulls and stags. To tell the truth, I even ate up a shepherd now and then.""Now, if I am the most guilty, I am ready to be sacrificed. But I think it best that each one confess his sins as I have done. Then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty.""""Your majesty,"" said the Fox, ""you are too good. Can it be a crime to eat sheep, such stupid mutton heads? No, no, your majesty. You have done them great honor by eating them up.""And so far as shepherds are concerned, we all know they belong to that puny race that pretends to be our masters.""All the animals applauded the Fox loudly. Then, though the Tiger, the Bear, the Wolf, and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds, all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent.It was now the Ass's turn to confess.""I remember,"" he said guiltily, ""that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests, I was so tempted by the tender grass and my hunger, that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it. I had no right to do it, I admit""A great uproar among the beasts interrupted him. Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of them! What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else! It was enough to hang anyone for, much more an Ass.Immediately they all fell upon him, the Wolf in the lead, and soon had made an end to him, sacrificing him to the gods then and there, and without the formality of an altar.The weak are made to suffer for the misdeeds of the powerful.",The weak are made to suffer for the misdeeds of the powerful.
The Shepherd & the Lion,"A Shepherd, counting his Sheep one day, discovered that a number of them were missing.Much irritated, he very loudly and boastfully declared that he would catch the thief and punish him as he deserved. The Shepherd suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region among the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves. But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him find the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifice.The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves, but just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep. In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees.""Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what he asks! To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Calf. Now I promise you a full-grown Bull, if you but make the thief go away!""We are often not so eager for what we seek, after we have found it.

"The Bees & Wasps, & the Hornet","A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Wasps declared positively that it belonged to them. The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs. The argument grew very pointed, and it looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle, when at last, with much good sense, they agreed to let a judge decide the matter. So they brought the case before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of the woods.When the Judge called the case, witnesses declared that they had seen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollow tree, who hummed loudly, and whose bodies were striped, yellow and black, like Bees.Counsel for the Wasps immediately insisted that this description fitted his clients exactly.Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision, so he adjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think it over. When the case came up again, both sides had a large number of witnesses. An Ant was first to take the stand, and was about to be cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court.""Your honor,"" he said, ""the case has now been pending for six weeks. If it is not decided soon, the honey will not be fit for anything. I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb. Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs.""The Wasps protested loudly. Wise Judge Hornet quickly understood why they did so: They knew they could not build a honey comb and fill it with honey.""It is clear,"" said the Judge, ""who made the comb and who could not have made it. The honey belongs to the Bees.""Ability proves itself by deeds.",Ability proves itself by deeds.
The Lark & Her Young Ones,"A Lark made her nest in a field of young wheat. As the days passed, the wheat stalks grew tall and the young birds, too, grew in strength. Then one day, when the ripe golden grain waved in the breeze, the Farmer and his son came into the field.""This wheat is now ready for reaping,"" said the Farmer. ""We must call in our neighbors and friends to help us harvest it.""The young Larks in their nest close by were much frightened, for they knew they would be in great danger if they did not leave the nest before the reapers came. When the Mother Lark returned with food for them, they told her what they had heard.""Do not be frightened, children,"" said the Mother Lark. ""If the Farmer said he would call in his neighbors and friends to help him do his work, this -wheat will not be reaped for a while yet.""A few days later, the wheat was so ripe, that when the wind shook the stalks, a hail of wheat grains came rustling down on the young Larks' heads.""If this wheat is not harvested at once,"" said the Farmer, ""we shall lose half the crop. We cannot wait any longer for help from our friends. Tomorrow we must set to work, ourselves.""When the young Larks told their mother what they had heard that day, she said:""Then we must be off at once. When a man decides to do his own work and not depend on any one else, then you may be sure there will be no more delay.""There was much fluttering and trying out of wings that afternoon, and at sunrise next day, when the Farmer and his son cut down the grain, they found an empty nest.Self-help is the best help.",Self-help is the best help.
The Cat & the Old Rat,"There was once a Cat who was so watchful, that a Mouse hardly dared show the tip of his whiskers for fear of being eaten alive. That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with his claws all ready for a pounce. At last the Mice kept so closely to their dens, that the Cat saw he would have to use his wits well to catch one. So one day he climbed up on a shelf and hung from it, head downward, as if he were dead, holding himself up by clinging to some ropes with one paw.When the Mice peeped out and saw him in that position, they thought he had been hung up there in punishment for some misdeed. Very timidly at first they stuck out their heads and sniffed about carefully. But as nothing stirred, all trooped joyfully out to celebrate the death of the Cat.Just then the Cat let go his hold, and before the Mice recovered from their surprise, he had made an end of three or four.Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever. But the Cat, who was still hungry for Mice, knew more tricks than one. Rolling himself in flour until he was covered completely, he lay down in the flour bin, with one eye open for the Mice.Sure enough, the Mice soon began to come out. To the Cat it was almost as if he already had a plump young Mouse under his claws, when an old Rat, who had had much experience with Cats and traps, and had even lost a part of his tail to pay for it, sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived.""Take care!"" he cried. ""That may be a heap of meal, but it looks to me very much like the Cat. Whatever it is, it is wisest to keep at a safe distance.""The wise do not let themselves be tricked a second time.",The wise do not let themselves be tricked a second time.
The Ass & His Shadow,"A Traveler had hired an Ass to carry him to a distant part of the country. The owner of the Ass went with the Traveler, walking beside him to drive the Ass and point out the way.The road led across a treeless plain where the Sun beat down fiercely. So intense did the heat become, that the Traveler at last decided to stop for a rest, and as there was no other shade to be found, the Traveler sat down in the shadow of the Ass.Now the heat had affected the Driver as much as it had the Traveler, and even more, for he had been walking. Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by the Ass, he began to quarrel with the Traveler, saying he had hired the Ass and not the shadow it cast.The two soon came to blows, and while they were fighting, the Ass took to its heels.In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.",In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.
"The Wolf, the Kid, & the Goat","Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for her household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.""Take good care of the house, my son,"" she said to the Kid, as she carefully latched the door. ""Do not let anyone in, unless he gives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all his race!'""Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he trotted to the door and knocked.""Down with the Wolf and all his race,"" said the Wolf softly.It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did not feel at all easy.""Show me a white paw,"" he said, ""or I won't let you in.""A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.""You can never be too sure,"" said the Kid, when he saw the Wolf making off to the woods.Two sureties are better than one.",Two sureties are better than one.
"The Miller, His Son, & the Ass","One day, a long time ago, an old Miller and his Son were on their way to market with an Ass which they hoped to sell. They drove him very slowly, for they thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them.""What foolishness,"" cried one, ""to walk when they might as well ride. The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be.""The Miller did not like to be laughed at, so he told his son to climb up and ride.They had gone a little farther along the road, when three merchants passed by.""Oho, what have we here?"" they cried. ""Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let the old man ride.""Though the Miller was not tired, he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride, just to please the Merchants.At the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell.""Look at the old fool,"" exclaimed one of them. ""Perched on the Ass, while that poor boy has to walk.""The Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him.They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road.""What a crime,"" cried one, ""to load up a poor dumb beast like that! They look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them.""""They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide,"" said another.The Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole. A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight.The Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river.The poor Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass besides.If you try to please all, you please none.","If you try to please all, you please none."
Jupiter & the Monkey,"There was once a baby show among the Animals in the forest. Jupiter provided the prize. Of course all the proud mammas from far and near brought their babies. But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey. Proudly she presented her baby among the other contestants.As you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly flat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature.""Laugh if you will,"" said the Mother Monkey. ""Though Jupiter may not give him the prize, I know that he is the prettiest, the sweetest, the dearest darling in the world.""Mother love is blind.",Mother love is blind.
The North Wind & the Sun,"The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak.""Let us agree,"" said the Sun, ""that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak.""""Very well,"" growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler.With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain.Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside.Gentleness and kind persuasion win where force and bluster fail.",Gentleness and kind persuasion win where force and bluster fail.
The Swallow & the Crow,"The Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage.Said the Swallow: ""Just look at my bright and downy feathers. Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why don't you dress better? Show a little pride!""""Your feathers may do very well in spring,"" replied the Crow, ""butI don't remember ever having seen you around in winter, and that's when I enjoy myself most.""Friends in fine weather only, are not worth much.","Friends in fine weather only, are not worth much."
"The Lion, the Ass, & the Fox","A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share.The Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain.Then he turned to the Fox.""You divide it,"" he roared angrily.The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail.The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely.""Who taught you to divide so fairly?"" he asked pleasantly.""I learned a lesson from the Ass,"" replied the Fox, carefully edging away.Learn from the misfortunes of others.",Learn from the misfortunes of others.
The Mole & his Mother,"A little Mole once said to his Mother:""Why, Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see!""Mother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.The little Mole peered at it.""Why, that's a pebble!""""Well, my son, that proves you've lost your sense of smell as well as being blind.""Boast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well.",Boast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well.
The Lion's Share,"A long time ago, the Lion, the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf agreed to go hunting together, sharing with each other whatever they found.One day the Wolf ran down a Stag and immediately called his comrades to divide the spoil.Without being asked, the Lion placed himself at the head of the feast to do the carving, and, with a great show of fairness, began to count the guests.""One,"" he said, counting on his claws, ""that is myself the Lion. Two, that's the Wolf, three, is the Jackal, and the Fox makes four.""He then very carefully divided the Stag into four equal parts.""I am King Lion,"" he said, when he had finished, ""so of course I get the first part. This next part falls to me because I am the strongest; and this is mine because I am the bravest.""He now began to glare at the others very savagely. ""If any of you have any claim to the part that is left,"" he growled, stretching his claws meaningly, ""now is the time to speak up.""Might makes right.",Might makes right.
The Wolves & the Sheep,"A pack of Wolves lurked near the Sheep pasture. But the Dogs kept them all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed in perfect safety. But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick the Sheep.""Why is there always this hostility between us?"" they said. ""If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I am sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and you will see what good friends we shall become.""The Sheep were easily fooled. They persuaded the Dogs to go away, and that very evening the Wolves had the grandest feast of their lives.Do not give up friends for foes.",Do not give up friends for foes.
The Fighting Cocks & the Eagle,"Once there were two Cocks living in the same farmyard who could not bear the sight of each other. At last one day they flew up to fight it out, beak and claw. They fought until one of them was beaten and crawled off to a corner to hide.The Cock that had won the battle flew to the top of the hen-house, and, proudly flapping his wings, crowed with all his might to tell the world about his victory. But an Eagle, circling overhead, heard the boasting chanticleer and, swooping down, carried him off to his nest.His rival saw the deed, and coming out of his corner, took his place as master of the farmyard.Pride goes before a fall.",Pride goes before a fall.
The Cock & the Fox,"A Fox was caught in a trap one fine morning, because he had got too near the Farmer's hen house. No doubt he was hungry, but that was not an excuse for stealing. A Cock, rising early, discovered what had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so he went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy.The Fox saw a slender chance of escape.""Dear friend,"" he said, ""I was just on my way to visit a sick relative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangled up. But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causing sorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string to pieces.""But the Cock was not to be so easily fooled. He soon roused the whole hen yard, and when the Farmer came running out, that was the end of Mr. Fox.The wicked deserve no aid.",The wicked deserve no aid.
The Ass in the Lion's Skin,"An Ass found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter. He dressed himself in it, and amused himself by hiding in a thicket and rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way. All took to their heels the moment they saw him.The Ass was so pleased to see the animals running away from him, just as if he were King Lion himself, that he could not keep from expressing his delight by a loud, harsh bray. A Fox, who ran with the rest, stopped short as soon as he heard the voice. Approaching the Ass, he said with a laugh:""If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me, too. But you gave yourself away with that silly bray.""A fool may deceive by his dress and appearance, but his words will soon show what he really is.","A fool may deceive by his dress and appearance, but his words will soon show what he really is."
