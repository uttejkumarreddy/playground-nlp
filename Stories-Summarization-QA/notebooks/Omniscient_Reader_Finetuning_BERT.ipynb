            "[<Document: {'content': \"Andy rolled over, pulling the light quilt along with him, then yanking it over his head like a monks cowl.The room was filled with dazzling lemony sunlight though it was only seven or so in the morning.And Saturday! thoughtknowHe peeked an eye out from his blankey-cave and turned curiously back towards the window.As usual, the cheery cacophony of bird voices wafted in through the east facing window.He recognized just about all of them, a hobby of his: the sweet peeping of house wrens, the singsong warbling of colorful goldfinches and the repetitive trilling of magpies.The entire symphony of birds didnt disturb his rest in the least, even the obnoxious jay's raspy,  that punctuated the melodies like an out of tune tuba.He found the morning birdsong to be as meditative as the nights, though the night had the added bonus of crickets and his favorite, owls.The sleep stealing culprit was Ralph, his dog.Hed pulled the entire right side of the curtain aside and was staring out into the yard.Ralph was a scruffy Jack Russell terrier with a mind of his own and a personality as delightful as a basket of baby chicks.Andys mom said he must be part cat, because he was master of .Oh Ralphie, not again, moaned Andy. Its too early.And Saturday.Lemme sleep some more.Ralph was a statue except for one brief ear flicker.Know you hear me, Andy said as he turned all the way over to observe his dog.Youre so weird. He mumbled.Great.Now I gotta pee.The ten-year-old boy grabbed a hoodie from the bedpost and sleepily sluffed into it.It was two weeks from summer vacation and would be hot out by 9am, but at seven, it was chilly.He pushed his feet into his plush red  slippers and headed for the door.You comin?You wanna go out?The small white and brown dog at last tore his gaze from the window and turned his deep chocolate eyes to his boy.As usual he was grinning, and Andys annoyance melted away like butter in a hot iron skillet.Ralph cocked his head the way Jack Russells do, just like the one in that old RCA ad with the phonograph.Andy knew the logo art was called, His Masters Voice because he collected memorabilia and stuff regarding that particular breed of dog.The choice of dog breed had been his. After careful consideration, much googling and wikapedia-ing, Andy decided the smarter the dog the better.He knew a smart dog would catch on to training and tricks faster than a dumber breed.The size, about 18 pounds when full grown, was perfect too, he could take Ralph just about anywhere.Added bonus- not only was Ralph allowed to sleep on Andys bed, he did not hog it either.Maybe a dumber dog would have been better. He teased Ralph, A big goofy Irish Setter or something.Ralph cocked his head the other way as if trying to figure out what his boy was saying.Cmon Ralph.The pup knew what  meant and decided it was his window of opportunity to go outside and pee.After letting Ralph out the back door, Andy went back down the hall to use the bathroom.When he was done, he knew he was up for good.He returned to his room and grabbed yesterdays cargo shorts off the floor.They had some grass stains- he and his chums had played during their lunch break- but he didnt care.He put on a fresh tee-shirt though, relishing the cleanly scented cotton and the softness of many washes.Mom had left a note on the kitchen table,  complete with her signature smiley-face.He stuffed the ten in his pocket and did the math automatically- 3.50 for oj, 3.00 for milkhed have 3.50 left for himself.That was always the deal., he thought.I can get a new deck of cards.Hed been practicing cards tricks for a month and his old deck had too many bent corners and was missing one of the jacks.Cmon Ralph, goin to the storehe kept his voice down.Mom had worked a double the night before and relished a good sleep as much as he did.It had been a good day.Full of fresh air and bicycle races with Richie and Sam, his two best friends.Bird watching in the woods behind their house, Andy enjoyed pointing out various breeds and calls.The grassy, woodsy scent of summer a constant reminder that school would be out soon.A lot of kids in Andys grade were gamers.Even if Andys mom could afford a game console  the cool kind- he pretty much thought all video games were a humongous waste of time.Besides, all the gamers had pasty skin, often decorated with premature pimples, and pale doughy bodies.He figured in about a hundred years, gamers would be a whole different genus of human being.They didnt even speak the same language.Hitting softballs and playing cowboys, his bike his horse and Ralph as his fearless sidekick, was more his style.Playing spacemen was another favorite.That night, Mom set up the tv trays in the living room.Every Saturday night they watched Svenghoulie together while eating hungry man dinners.Thered be pudding or jello for dessert too, with cool whip!The old-timey movies were awesome, usually black and white, and always creepy.The narrator, Svenghoulie, was hysterical!Mom said, Oh!I remember this one!Actually saw it in a drive-in. Tonights movie was , and as usual she added, You sure this wont give you nightmares?No Mom, Im cool.He said, eyes glued to the outdated tv set, Ralph will protect me.Two hours later they said goodnight, did their nighttime bathroom rituals, and went to their rooms.Andy left the window open but closed the curtains snugly.Mom and son went to church on Sundays, but service wasnt until 10am.They'd agreed to sleep in until 9, skip breakfast, and eat a big lunch afterwards.Maybe even a picnic by the shady pond in the woods.At 7am shards of brilliant sunlight battered Andys eyelids, his inside view was bright orangey-red.The Blob in his dream vanished like the Cheshire Cat, the last part of the hungry creature to faint into invisibility was a mouthful of sharks teeth.(In Andys nightmares, all the monsters had sharks teeth, stained crimson and dripping with stringy saliva.)Ral-phieeeeeeeseriously? He whined to the dog, who once again was sitting in the window, the sunlight streaming around him like the bright ethereal luminescence of Gods robes.Ralph sat still as a grave marker, staring out into the woods.Ugh.Grunted Andy as he rolled over, putting the warmth to his back.Andy sat at the kitchen table while his mom finished up loading the picnic basket- tuna sandwiches, potato chips for him, Smart Food popcorn for her, sliced apples, with caramel sauce for dipping.Ralphs been super weird lately.Wierder than normal? She asked.Well, yeah.He does this thing where he opens the curtain and stares out the window, Andy said, then added, Hes done it for over a week now.He just sits there, looking at the forest, doesnt move at all when I call himThat Selective Deafness Cat Syndrome, eh? she said, not suppressing a grin.Andy didnt smile back.Her grin faltered, then withered all together.Andy said, And, its  seven every time.Its totally creeping me out...His voice wavered as he looked down at the hands wringing in his lap.His mom came over then, concerned more for Andy than the dog. Would you feel better if we took him to see the vet?Mom, we cant afford that.Besides the vet wont find anything physically wrong. Andy sighed, Maybe an exorcistThis time his mother had a hard time suppressing a laugh, she had to bite her cheeks.She let out a gush of relief when Andy tittered a bit himself.How about the next time he does his weird window- staring thing you come get me? I wanna see this thing for myself.Then well take it from there.Its probably just a phaseor a cat-thing.Theyve been known to freak people out by staring at closets and whatnot.That night, Andy again closed the curtains.He thought about safety-pinning them shut but decided that he really wanted Mom to see the odd, creepy behavior.The boy was rudely awoken by bright light pounding on his eyelids like a madman axing a door.His eyes felt puffy.He felt unnaturally weary., he thought.Something was not right.The room simmered with .The curtain was open, the bright light dazzling.But for the first time in a week, Ralph was not sitting there.Andy glanced at the vintage, black-faced Westclox on his nightstand, knowing it was 7am again.It was am!He sat bolt upright as if yanked up on puppet strings.His heart hammered like a ten-foot hummingbird.His flesh prickled, just like his shins had prickled when he had accidentally run through a patch of stinging nettles in the forest.The light suddenly winked out, leaving spots in his vision.Im dreaming, thats all.Just a crazy dream.Andy reached down to the foot of the bed in the inky darkness.Ralph was not there.The bedroom door was still closed.The panicking boy leapt out of bed and stumbled over a sneaker, nearly braining himself on the windowsill.He caught himself and leaned out on shakey arms as far as he could. couldWith mounting alarm, he realized there were no night sounds.The air was a dead lead curtain- no crickets, no whip-or-wills, no tree frogs- just nothing.He screamed then, MOM!!!MOOOOOOOM!!!Andy slumped at the kitchen table.It was four in the morning.His small hands cradled a cup of warm milk.Through his nostrils, he sucked in great gobs of snot.As soon as its light out- only an hour and a half- we go look for Ralph, ok?Andy only nodded.She had talked him out of going into the woods in the dark but had allowed him to search the small property with a flashlight.While her son searched outside, she had gotten into jeans, a sweatshirt, and her grubby old Vans. She braced herself for the dreadful cry of anguish, Ralphs mutilated body discovered.She flashed back to nine years earlier.Shed had a dog.She never spoke of him, no point really.Andy had been only one when Bernie died and had no memory of the kind and gentle beagle mix.The dog had been Josephs, but it was clear from the start, the sad-eyed pup was hers.Joseph was NOT a good man.Dogs know instantly, people can take decades.The blood in her urine was the last straw.He beat her, he beat the dog.What would he do to their baby son?She had packed up her little Toyota with necessities, that included Bernie.Shed found this small but cozy, clean home reasonably offered for rent.The tidy lot was a half-acre, with town just two miles away, and lush green woods edging the back of the property. Just the place a boy would be stoked to grow up in.When Andy was just past his first birthday, Bernie got himself killed.The old kitchen door had had a doggie flap in it, Bernie came and went as he pleased.He never wandered too far.Marie-Claire had scolded him a few times at first, and he seemed content to rule the yard. Hed been about eleven and had not lost even an ounce of puppy essence, the one where every butterfly chase was the first.One night a screeching, hissing sound woke her.The sound like a storage unit filled with Tasmanian devils!Then shed heard Bernies frantic barks.Barks so unlike his normal beagle ululating.Shed never forget the scream.She had had to find Bernie, though she had known he was gone.The tiniest flame of hope had flickered on, like a miniature lantern held by an elf.She had found the body, ragged and bloody, gutted by sharp feral claws. The loss was a permanent hole punched in her heart.On this terrible night, she empathized with her young son. But his wail of despair never came.At the first light, Marie-Claire and Andy crossed the yard and tromped through the woods, sticking to the deer paths that wove through the dense vegetation like an enormous spiders web.Each went a mile in different directions until all the forested land was covered.At 10am theyd tiredly given up.At noon, Andy rode his bike into town.He peddled fast to keep his eyes dry, choking on sobs when he looked down- no spunky little sidekick, no best friend keeping pace.He posted flyers all around town.Solicitation ads were strictly forbidden, even fined, but lost pet flyers were allowed, neighbors commiserated together.The sad boy asked any and all whod listen, if theyd seen a wire-haired brown and white spotted Jack Russell Terrier.As townsfolk shook their heads dolefully, he pointed to his telephone number on the sheet, just in case.Every day after school he rode through town, not really expecting any luck, but too restless to sit at home and dwell on his depression.After two weeks his hope petered out, like the last sliver of orangey sun dipping below the horizon.It tortured her entire being- hearing her son softly sobbing every night as he sat by his window, his eyes straining to see a flash of white fur in the moonlight.Well get another dog, Marie-Claire said one morning at the table, then quickly added, only when youre ready of course.I keep expecting to see Ralph running up the driveway to greet me after school. Andy said, fresh tears burning tracks down his baby-soft cheeks.They both knew he wasnt ready for a new dog; he knew she was trying to cheer him up.Thats why you havent had Richie or Sam over isnt it?Mom intuition.Andy nodded, Its not that Im afraid to cry around them.Richie was a wreck after Cooper died.I just dont want them to feel bad.Sadness is uncomfortable to be around.Mom had to turn to her potato peeling then, her turn to only nod.He sounded forty.That night, Andy left his curtains open, as he did every night now.He still wondered about that weird light he had dreamed about at 3am.Deep down he knew it was connected to Ralphs disappearance, but he chased those imaginative thoughts out of his mind like a mob armed with pitchforks.Thoughts like that froze the blood of his body and brought the taste of bile to his throat.He dreamt of circular metal ships and big-eyed stick figures with shiny titanium sharks teeth.Morning brightness pressed against his eyelids.When he realized it was not warm summer sunlight, his eyes flew open like pistol shots.It was unnaturally silent again, just as before- no crickets, no owl, no lullabying birds.It was just as it had been two weeks before and he knew when he looked at the clock it would 3am.He was paralyzed with dread, while his guts vibrated like live wires.theyHis room was northest Siberia, his toes in danger of frostbite and his teeth chattered like the windup ones they sold at the magic and gift shop.He turned and reached for the hoody on his bedpost.When he turned back to the brightly lit window,Ralph was there!Just before the light winked out, Andy noted that Ralph was not statue-still this time.His stubby, sausage-like tail whapped uncontrollably against the floor making soft  sounds.In the pitch darkness, Andy whispered, Ralphie?Ralphie was  cat-like either, he happily bounded over in two strides and leapt up to the bed.The crickets outside started up as Andy found the light-switch.He hugged Ralph so hard the dog made a wheeze and a yip.Sorry boy, said Andy.He looked into Ralphs furry facesomething was odd.But whatever it was eluded him, the small bedside lamp shed little light.Andy tilted the shade towards Ralph, but he still couldnt put a finger on the oddness.Where have you been? Andy asked, agog with pure bliss- his best friend was home! he thought.They used to be such a dark shade of brown they looked black in low light. The dogs eyes now swam with flecks of gold, the amber irises glowed as if not from the moonlight coming in in window, but from within the dogs very essence. eyes.He didnt know what that meant, only that it felt right.Just like you knew Yoda was super smart before he even opened his little green mouth.Did you have an exciting adventure?Andys eyes widened with wonder as Ralph nodded., thought Andy.Where did you go?Oh, wait- thats dumb.You cant .Can you?Ralph shook his head left to right.But you really do understand me, dontchoo boy?Ralph nodded.Tail thumping on the quilt.MOM!!!MOOOOOOOM!!!\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '219_Night Sun.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '48205968e6b0d7a8a7ba4481c149952b'}>, <Document: {'content': \"Mr SunOh, Mr sun, sun, mr golden sun,Please shine down on me.Oh, mr sun, sun, mr golden sun,Hiding behind a tree.These little children are asking you,Please come out so we can play with you.Mr sun, sun, mr golden sun,Please shine down on me.

Lou asked with her mouth full of cereals. She gazed at her father with her big blue eyes and nodded assertively while spilling milk all over the kitchen table. Andrew lifted his head from his morning newspaper, his lips curled in amusement. Oh no! he exclaimed in a pretended voice. Now how is mommy going to die today, then? Is she going to die the same way as yesterday?The scent of coffee began to fill the richly decorated kitchen and the vigorous light of the morning sun was breaking through the curtains, illuminating the ivory marble floor. He listened to Lous imaginative tales with pleasure, adding a comment here and there to heighten the grotesqueness of their little game, which she approved of with a giggle.After his third cup of coffee, he glanced at the clock  it was already well past 8 AM.Now hurry up, my dear, Andrew said. Or else we will be late for kindergarten again, and we dont want that to happen after what Miss OHara has told us last time, do we?Lou shook her head with such force that, for a moment, her face disappeared beneath her long unkempt hair. She wolfed down the remainder of her cereal bowl and went upstairs to get dressed. Meanwhile, Andrew contemplated on having another cup of coffee and, as he was pouring the last bit from the kettle into his mug, he started to think about the next chapter of his historical novel in progress on the Thirty Years War that he originally intended to undertake that day. Just the thought of it caused him a headache, so instead, he tried to focus on the bitter aftertaste that the coffee was exerting on his tongue. His mind kept wandering off to his dysfunctional relationship with Annie. Ever since she had taken over the CEO position in the insurance company, things started to go downhill between the two of them. It was probably already sometime before that, but he liked to think that it was her occupational and financial success that was responsible for his misery. She was barely at home anymore, and he couldnt remember when they last had dinner together, not to mention sex. He wasnt even sure whether she came home at all, and he wondered whether all this had eventually enticed him to engage with Lous silly little game.Ready to go? Lou yelled from down the hall.He startled and replied, Yes, dear. Andrew placed his mug down near the stove and made his way down the hall. Lou stood next to the front door, impatiently tapping her foot on the ground and smoothening her favourite little jumper that was beaming like a rainbow. She handed Andrew his jacket and noticed a fresh coffee stain on her father's shirt, but didn't say anything. So tell me, how was your day at kindergarten, my dear? Andrew asked his daughter while slicing the potatoes for dinner. The oven was pleasantly humming in the background and the smell of roast chicken and rosemary gradually began to spread in the kitchen.We didnt do nothing special, really, she said., my dear,  special, he corrected her, and let the chopped potatoes plunge into the saucepan full of water.But I think Miss OHara will want to speak to you again  she and the other children seemed taken aback when I told them how mommy was gonna die today. I dont know  they never take it the way you take it, daddy. I wish they were more fun, just the way you are! Lou said.He gave her a warm smile and chuckled. Now, now, my dear. Weve been through this. You mustnt talk about your little game at kindergarten. Indeed, you mustnt talk about it . You see, people may misunderstand you, just as Miss OHara has already in the past, and then daddy gets a whole lot of phone calls and has to explain to all these people that nothing of what you said is meant seriously and that there is indeed no need to worry whatsoever. Now, he said, his voice becoming softer again, are you hungry?After a hearty dinner, Lou settled down in her room with her crayons and her colouring book, the door left ajar. Andrew, meanwhile, had nestled down in his favourite armchair with a mystery novel and a cup of tea in the living room. He read it with such excitement, invariably thinking of how wonderful it would feel if he himself could write so grippingly, that he did not hear the phone ringing.Daddy daddy, the phone is ringing. It must be Miss OHara who will want to speak to you about today, Lou yelled from her room.Reluctantly, he put the novel away and wearily got up from his armchair. He deliberately moved slower than usual towards the phone in hopes that the ringing might stop before he reached the receiver, but it didn't. Andrew glanced at the display and, with displeasure, he saw the digits of an unfamiliar number. For a moment, he was tempted to leave the phone ringing but then decided against it. Anxious to not let his displeasure of receiving a call at this late hour become discernible, he cleared his throat and picked up the phone. Andrew swallowed hard. He put down the receiver and stood in the living room like a wax figure. Except for the ticking of the parlour clock and the light scratching noise of Lous crayons, there was nothing but silence. He slowly approached his daughters room and pushed the door wide open. Lou, my dear, there is something that I must tell you. Something bad, something very bad, has happened. Your mother Oh you dont need to tell  daddy, she interrupted him playfully with a bright smile on her face. You see, I already . In fact, I told you so this morning, didnt I?\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '221_A Silly Little Game.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '4fe1096592867eaf68216691deb34df'}>]\n"

That was the last thing I heard before my life had changed forever!I waitedin the car while my mom was screaming on the phone about a lake house in some kinda woods, I think. It was winter and 10 degrees so I hoped we weren't going there. Finally, my mom got in the car and she didn't say anything. I asked her where we were going and she said don't worry about it. At this point I was a little bit scared, like is my mom a criminal or something. An hour went by and we were in the woods where I have never been and there was a house. One house In the middle of the woods is strange. Is this what my mom was talking about on the phone? The next thing I know my mom is getting out of the car while telling me to stay here and to stay put. 10 minutes pass and my mom is still in the house. I was on my phone texting my friend Lucy. I tell her everything. Then finally my mom comes out of the house and says. To unpack my stuff, and that my room is upstairs to the left. I was confused because I didn'tpack anything, but then my mom added  go look in the trunk. So then I knew she had packed some of my things. About 3 hours later my mom had me come to the living room. When I got there she had this worried look on her face. I thought it was something about my dad, he went missing 6 years ago. Then she said something WAY different. I was shocked about what she said and I was also confused. My mom had told me I was going to have powers! She said that on my 11th birthday which was on march 9th. Of course, I didn'tbelieve her. I was in shock. So later that night I wasin my room thinking about what my mom had said. I remember I was thinking about how my birthday was in 2 days and maybe I could have powers, but then I was like there's no way I could have powers. So the next day I avoided my mom until dinner. I asked her a bunch of questions like mom were you telling the truth yesterday. then she said she was 100% telling the truth. At dinner my mom talked to me about being homeschooled and how she is going to sell our house. Those 2 things made me very mad because I would never see my house again, but then she said we would go get our stuff tomorrow. I was so mad at her because she took everything from me. The next day was my birthday, I was going to see if what my mom had said was true. For breakfast my mom had made me french toast! She told me to go outside and play so I did but I was bummed out because Lucy didn't come to my birthday. About 2 hours of me playing outside, my mom came out and told me to follow her so I did. She took me to this lake and told me my power was levtashion. I was shocked at what she said because she had a serious face. An hour later I started to feel kinda sick. I told my mom and she said the time has finally come. She also said the feeling sick was a symptom of getting your powers. 20 minutes later I was puking in the toilet and then I yelled at my mom to get out of the bathroom and she wouldn't so I yelled again and then something went up in the air (shampoo bottle). My mom told me to keep yelling at her so I did and basically everything went up in the air! My mom was so exceeded,it was dinner time so I got up to go eat dinner and all the things fell on the floor. We had someburgers and fries. 4 months go by and i have my powers undercut on and then one night my mom said she had saved our house and that we were moving back in so then 2 days later we started to get packing and then she told me that all girls that are 11 have powers and if they tell any boy they will die.  2 weeks later we were all moved in and I was hanging out with lucy, her power was Elvis's belly and we played hide and seek a lot. When I and Lucy got older (22) we were still friends and we hung out a lot. We worked in the same job we had an apartment.

            "               <Document: {'content': 'Anna, one of these days all these lies will get you in a lot of trouble, warned Mom for the hundredth time.But did Anna listen? No. Eight-year old Anna just shook her head full of dark curls defiantly and went on telling lies. She told lies when she did not have to. She told lies even when telling the truth would be a lot easier.Anna is that my magic eraser you are using? asked Samantha, her best friend. Did you take it from my pencil case without asking?No, its not yours. replied Anna, as she continued erasing. Its mine.No its not. My name is written on it, responded Samantha angrily.Samantha knew that Anna was lying and that made her very mad. She did not want to be Annas friend anymore. Actually, everyone was tired of Annas lies. Her classmates complained to the teacher and the teacher complained to her mother and her mother complained to her father but no one knew what to do about it.Till one day when everything came to a head. Anna was playing with her Frisbee in her back yard. She threw the Frisbee so hard that it went flying over the fence onto the dirt path which ran behind the house. She opened the small garden gate and went to retrieve the disc. She had never gone out this way before and she found herself in a field of wild mushrooms that had sprouted all over. Anna soon realized that these were no ordinary mushrooms. They were all in different colors and had different patterns. Some had red tops with white polka dots, others had blue top with purple stripes; there were yellow ones with orange diamonds and black ones with silver stars.Annas eyes lit up in fascination and she reached down and touched the black one. Ah, it felt as soft as velvet. Then, to her amazement, the silver stars started to twinkle and the mushroom started to grow big and was soon bigger than her. Soon all the mushrooms started to grow. Anna could not tell if the mushrooms were growing bigger or if she was growing smaller but everything looked gigantic to her. She realized that they werent actually mushrooms, they were houses with windows and doors and smoking chimneys.She wondered who would live in a place like this? And then she saw him, a pixie wearing a red sweater and green leggings, riding a bicycle, which had a basket, attached to the front handle. He was pushing down on the pedals fast. He seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere. he rang the bell. The astounded Anna could not move out of the way fast enough, so the pixie, trying to avoid her, collided with the tree. All the stuff fell out of his basket, the freshly baked bread, the marmalade and a very delicious looking cupcake.Ouch, he screamed in pain, rubbing his bruised knees. Why did you not move out the way human girl, did you not hear me ring the bell?No, I did not, lied Anna, though she had heard it loud and clear. Here I can help you with your stuff.While the pixie was busy rubbing his bruised knees and hollering in pain, Anna picked up the bread and the marmalade. And then she saw the cupcake, it simply looked delicious and her mouth started to salivate. She just had to take a bite. So she took a teeny bite, hoping it would not be noticed.It tasted of fresh strawberries that had been covered in chocolate and fresh cream, and it melted in her mouth. She had never eaten anything as delicious before. She took another bite and then another. Before she knew it, she had eaten the entire cupcake. What was she going to do now? She hoped the pixie would not notice!Here pixie, Ive picked up all your stuff, said Anna.Where is the cupcake I baked for the wizards birthday? replied the pixie knitting his brows as he looked around.I did not see any cupcake, lied Anna. Maybe you left it at home.I did not leave it at home! What is that around your mouth? asked the pixie stomping his foot angrily. Is that icing? Are those strawberries stain? Did you eat the cupcake?No, I did not, said Anna as she hastily wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.You are lying, and I refuse to take blame for the missing cupcake.You will come along with me and you will confess to the wizard about eating his cupcake, said the pixie as he grabbed Anna by her arm.Anna tried to fight him off but realized that she was too small and that her hands and feet had pins and needles so she was not able to get away from him. The pixie picked her up and put her in the basket of his bicycle and then rode straight into the midst of the mushroom houses. They rode for what seemed like hours but in reality it was only a few minutes. By now Anna was starting to feel very frightened and she started to sob, she missed her mother and her father and also her best friend Samantha a lot. She wondered if they were all missing her too and were looking for her.The pixie rode down a winding dirt path till he reached a forbidding castle with a moat around it. Tring, tring he rang his bell and the drawbridge came down. He rode through the bridge and Anna could see that some elves and fairies and foxes and hares were preparing for a feast.Whats happening? asked Anna always so curious.Its the wizards birthday and we are throwing him a party, replied the pixie as he parked his bicycle against the castle wall.Anna forgot all about the cupcake and felt excited for she loved parties. They walked to where everyone was collected. There was a table set with sandwiches and chips, donuts covered with sprinkles and rainbow flavored cotton candy, there was fruit punch and lemonade. Anna could not wait to eat all the good stuff.On another table was a heap of presents wrapped in colorful wrapping paper. There were balloons and streamers floating in the air and music was playing. Everyone was having a wonderful time.Then came the wizard looking so handsome, dressed in a shiny black suit, his pointy black hat had the golden sun and silver moon shining through it. Everyone cheered and sang. Soon it was time to cut the cake. But there was no cake.Hey where is my cake? asked the wizard petulantly. Pixie did you not bake me your special cupcake?The pixie looked crestfallen, he pointed to Anna and said She ate the cupcake.Everyone looked horrified! She ate the wizards cupcake!!No, I did not! exclaimed Anna shaking her head. It fell in the dirt.Right after she uttered the lie, the wizard looked straight into her eyes and his deep black eyes flashed green, he muttered something under his breath. Everyone stood still, they were all petrified of the wizards temper and his spells, but to their delight he kept his temper in check. After all it was his birthday.Since no birthday party can be complete without a cake, the wizard pulled out his magic wand and created a huge cupcake that everyone got to share, even Anna who really should not have.Tfos ih sl dulicesh, exclaimed Anna, but wait what was happening?Annas words were making no sense. They sounded gibberish and no one in Mushroom Land understood gibberish, every time Anna spoke everyone just shook their head and walked away.At first she was perplexed at what was happening but then she got really scared. What if she could never talk normaly again!Hkln md! she begged the pixie who had brought her on the bicycle.But he could not understand her. Poor Anna maybe she should not have told all those lies! The thought of her mother and her father and Samantha never understanding her words made her very sad and she started to cry. The more she cried the more it put a damper on the rejoicing.Who is ruining my party? asked the wizard in his loud booming voice.I ag sh skotry, wept Anna. I pgumfxe whgf nwcdt lje ahson.Now the wizard knew gibberish as he often spoke it himself especially when he muttered his curses and spells so he understood what she just said.I can see that you are truly sorry for all the lies youve told, and since it is my birthday and I am in a terrific mood, I am willing to remove the spell, he said. But there is a condition.Anna was desperate to agree to anything, she only wanted to be able to speak normally again.If you ever lie again your words will turn to gibberish and nothing will be able to break that spell.I promise I will never tell another lie, said Anna crying and then laughing to hear normal words coming from her tongue.The grand birthday party was coming to an end and the pixie offered to give Anna a ride on his way back home.Since that strange day much to her mother and her father and everybody elses surprise Anna has not told another lie.

Its huge.I hate big parties.No one talks to me, and I dont particularly like talking to people I barely know either, being polite when I just want to leave.Are you supposed to bring a present?I wouldnt want to be the only, or one of the few not to bring a present for the boss.Joe bought the boss a new set of speakers.You know what a big suck up he is.He asked people to chip in to help pay for it.All you have to do is go up to the Joe, and give him some money. Then you can stand with the others who chipped in, and be part of the we that got the boss a nice gift.I gave Joe some money.Oh thats great!Spending hard-earned on our idiot boss.And Joe will be sure to hog all the credit, all the glory. I guess that would be all right.But are we supposed to take a plus one with us, not come alone.I dont have a plus one.I could be the odd man out.No worries, George.I wont be taking a plus one with me, not since the divorce.And I know a bunch of guys from the office who are going it alone.With a bit of luck a few of the single secretaries will be there as well.You might get lucky. Thats all I need, to be shot down by one of those snobby secretaries, like Jeanie or Sophie.That would be great for my reputation and self-esteem.I would be mocked for months by the guys at work. So where is the bosss place?I think I heard that its on the far side of town, so it would hard to find if you have never been there before, which I havent.Id hate to get lost, and look a fool You do not have to worry about that.You cant miss the boss house.Its the tallest building for blocks, and has solar panels on the roof.It is really easy to find, like a castle towering over the meagre houses of the villagers. There goes another good excuse, flushed right down the toilet. Now I will have to think up another.Fred must go out a lot. Well, that seems okay then.I guess if I go, I wouldnt have any problems finding the boss place then.Now, what about how you dressThe boss dresses kind of fancy at work, expensive jacket almost a tuxedo, and pants that look like they get ironed every day.Im kind of an informal dresser myself, as you can see from what I am wearing right now.I dont own a suit jacket, and I long ago forgot how to tie a tie, and bowties look dinky to me  for clowns and male strippers.Do you think he would expect a kind of dress code? From what I know it will be quite informal.I have seen the boss rip off his tie when he gets into his car.And no one I talked to is dressing up, so I dont think that youll have any problems wearing the right sort of clothes.Its come as you are. Okay, what can I say now? What is left as an excuse? What about drinking?Are there going to be undeclared drinking contests among the men, with those who only have one or two drinks being declared losers?Ive heard about such things from my brother.Im a light drinker myself, and I do not want to be shamed for being one. There wasnt anything like that at the bosss last birthday party.That was about a month before you were hired.Im a light drinker myself, and I did not have any problems the last time.You would be okay. What can I say now?Im getting desperate here.Wait.Ive got one more. What about smoking? Will that be permitted, even outside? Im an occasional smoker, especially when I get nervous.And parties make me nervous.I dont think that the boss smokes, and he might strongly disapprove of those of us who do, even occasionally.Youve got no worries there.The boss smokes.Theres a room in his office that smells of cigarette smoke.And at his last birthday party, he was outside several times with the other smokers. There is a slight pause. So are you going to come to the party or not? Well see.I dont know just yet.   Hello, hello, hello, Im here  George the party boy is here..Lets knock back some shots, bust a few moves dancing, I think I see Jeanie standing there in the far corner, all by her lonesome.And we can talk real bad about people who arent here tonight.Boss-man, have we ever got something special for you as a birthday present.LET US PAR-TEH.\\tHeh, wheres my man big Fred. He is the man who told me about this big time shindig.I want to thank him for that. I havent been to a party in at least two weeks.I was going a little stir crazy.Oh dont you know.Fred hates parties.

A place where only kindness reigns, a place where evilness can never grow. A place where even on a rainy day you will see the sunshine. A place so warm It is tinted with yellow. This place must be what yellow feels like.She lives in a village surrounded with trees.Lively plantsBright flowersHappy facesFree animalsNo matter where you look there is no hint of cruelty living in this world.Everyday she wakes up with a smile on her face while listening to the birds singing peacefully in harmony. She get up everyday and never forgets to water the plants, she grew a garden so beautiful that butterflies and bees never get tired of visiting it everyday. Everyday, the people in her village plants a new tree and grew lots of garden until they ran out of place to plant. The air is so clean, the only scent you can smell is the lingering scent of daisies and lavender. They treat every animal with kindness no matter what they look like. Fury or not, tamed or wild, they make sure every animal is loved. Every night her mother sings her lullaby while she is sleeping under the moonlight while the crickets sings along with her mother.Everyday is special in their village, the people are always smiling, no signs of greediness. The people never failed to help others.All of this are because of and old saying from their ancestors. Mother Nature is so kind that she let us live in her, to repay herwe must be kind to her and to always be in peace with natureThe girl ran her fingers to the carved words below the statue of a dove in the center of our village as she was reading it. We must. The girlwhispered and looked at the sky.***Tomorrow is my birthday and my mother and I will bake a cake for the village to share, every year we do this to strengthen the bond of the people. Why is it so peaceful, mother?. I asked her calmly. Her eyebrows furrowed and she looked at me with her gentle eyes and asked  dont you like peaceful?. I was silent for a minute. I grew tired of being peaceful mother, I want something that makes my heartbeat so fast I could hear it. Maybe, I crave chaos so much because I never got to experience it. I like it, mother. I love being in peace. I lied.That night I couldnt sleep, all I did was stare at the ceilingandthink of the endless possibilities that I might experience in another world. A chaotic world. wake up, sunshine. Its your birthday!. My mom greeted me with a smile. The moment I opened my eyes I saw my mothers beautiful face with excitement all over her face.Its my birthdayI went outside and wandered in the garden for a bit. Everyday always have a hint of yellow but today is different it is cold and blue, the melancholic kind of blue. The kind of blue that can turn your insides upside down. I closed my eyes  and ignored the melancholic atmosphere, my eyebrows furrowed. What is that smell? It smells like rotten fish. I opened my eyes and a shocking event flashed before my eyes.I gasped and covered my eyes in fear,Blood... Blood everywhere... The blood splattered all over the place... All I could hear was screeching and laughter... Pain... They are in pain yet these cruel people are laughing.  I just saw a man slit the throat of a pig. I heard the pic cried in pain. I slowly opened my eyes and wandered around the place. I saw a lot of horrible things.A man slaughtering every kind of animals, some animals are even turned into clothing. I looked at the people, the smile on their faces when they slaughter poor and innocent animals is scary. The smirk and the look of satisfaction is frightening. Why must they do this? What did the animals ever do to these people? I walked around hoping to find a kind soul in this awful place but instead I saw an empty field with a lot of wounded trees.I looked around hoping to find flowers but I couldnt. all I could see is dead grass and No! dont cut the poor trees, you have cut a lot of trees already. I shouted while running towards them. But they dont seem to hear me. I tried to take the axe and saw in their hands but I couldnt. all I can do is watch them ruin our mother nature as I cry in agony.My knees fell in to the ground as I looked up the sky, I couldnt even see the sky all I could see is dark clouds. A raindrop fell in my face, at first I thought it was just my tears. It rained, it rained so hard all I could see is fog.I can feel her, I could hear her. I could hear mother nature cry in anguish.Im sorry, mother. Im sorry, I couldnt stop them. Im sorry you have to suffer like thisThe sun shined again, I was supposed to be happy. But I could feel my skin burning, why is it so hot? I looked at the sun. I was looking for a place to stay shelter me away from the agonizing heat of the sun but all I could see is the sea. I was going to dive in the water but it looks filthy. I could see an island full of trash and the horrible and unbearable smell.Wait. I looked around and saw a polar bear so skinny you could see through his bones. I ran to it and hugged him. oh bear, what has happed to you?. The bear was too weak to even move. I looked at him and all I could see is sadness. I hugged him tight and cried. Im sorry I whispered to his ears. What is this place?! Is this hell?!. I shouted in frustration. This is what a chaotic world looks like, sweetie. This is reality, this is what the real world looks like. Its chaotic and not beautiful. I heard the gentle voice of my mother, I cant even look at her. All I could do is cry.hush, love. Everything will be okay. Her voice is so comforting, I wish it could make me forget about my worries. I-Ifthis is reality, then what was the world that we lived in, mother?. I asked between my sobs, Im confused about everything. we live in a fairy tale, sweetheart. She said and hugged me even tighter. You have two choices, either we will go back home and live a perfect life or live here and be baked in the sun. My mother joked to release the tension.  Whatever your decision is I will come with you. But, reality isnt that bad. You have only seen the bad things about humanity. There is still a kind soul here somewhere, sweetie. I just gave her a reassuring smile to let her know that I feel better now. What I saw was already enough to make a decision. This horrible memory will forever be buried in my soul. Happy birthday to you!. The villagers cheered as I blew the candle.I regretted thinking I crave chaos when in fact I could not even bear to see my hands getting wounded.I could have been brave but I chose to be a coward and lived the life I want even if its only a fairy tale. I chose to leave a peaceful life and turned my back on the cruel reality.Life is better in a fairy tale, anyway.Or is it?', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6274549720908749, 'meta': {'name': '320_It\\x92s All better in a Fairy Tale.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ac755238cb740f5a96cb77c1dbbf4ea7'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': 'Quite a long time ago when I was in school I recall my closest companion called me late night on Saturday to welcome me on her birthday following day. I was glad and exceptionally eager to go there yet I expected to take authorization from my folks. I went to my Papa\\'s room and gradually asked him, \"Father tomorrow is my closest companions birthday and I truly need to go.\" Father said, \"Alright I dont mind however ask your mother.\" I went to Mom and said, \"Dear Mom\" Unexpectedly she answered, \"What do you need.\" I resembled stunned, \"Mother how would you realize that I need to say something.\" She said, \"The manner in which you are talking shows that\" and she grinned. I asked her, \"Mother, I need to go tomorrow.\" She said, \"Alright you can go yet u must be back before 10.\" At that point my arrangements began. I made 1 card for my companion and begin choosing materials for the gathering, lastly everything finished and I rested and only one thing was there to me all the time THE PARTY. I was trusting that the night will end and the gathering to start. Next morning my Mom was shock to see me, no alert, no Mom\\'s admonition just I woke up without help from anyone else. The entire day hosted passed and now its get-together time. My dad dropped me to my companions place and said me that he will be once again at 10. I said, \"alright\" I fled.. I delighted in a ton at party. My companion cherished that card which I made for her and everyone in the gathering adored my dress. I was joyous beyond words. We ate, we played such countless games and it was 10 at long last. I recalled my Mom\\'s recommendation that I ought to be back till 10. I came out and begin looking for my father, yet I was unable to have the option to discover him. I was so stressed and frightened, everyone was inside, I was separated from everyone else there. I sat tight there for 5 to 10 min yet standing by alone is by all accounts more than the time. I began strolling, I thought at any rate I can return home by strolling as my house was 20 min away from my companions place. As I was strolling I was sobbing as I have never strolled alone out and about that too around evening time. Out of nowhere I heard somebody calling something. I was frightened and I began strolling quick. I thought some hooligan was there or some phantom As I was strolling quick I heard somebody strolling quick behind me. I began running and crying, at that point I saw a few vehicles left there. I took cover behind those vehicles. I saw one shadow looking for me. I petitioned god to save me and to assist me with arriving at home. After at some point I was unable to see that shadow. I came out gradually and ran towards my home. At last I arrived at home. I embraced my mother and I began crying. She began posing such countless inquiries what happened,why you are crying and everything except I couldn\\'t answer any of them. After at some point I loose and said everything to mother. She got terrified and keeping in mind that we were talking about my dad came and asked what occurred. When I began disclosing to him my story he said, \"I saw you and I was shouting at you however you were fleeing from me and unexpectedly you vanished. I was looking through you there. I arrived behind schedule there as my tire got cut.\" My mother blasted out chuckling and told my father everything, I was stunned to hear that and felt assuaged. My dad embraced me and said, \"You ought to have stand by there.\" My mother said, \"You ought to be quiet and solid in each circumstance.\" Yet, they said they are truly cheerful and pleased with me that I returned home. That day I laid down with my folks and truly had a sense of security and secure. Following day I went to class I told my companions all that occurred with me the previous evening they heard everything and were shock that I courageously face everything.. So that was the best party and brave evening and incredible reaction from everybody I adored thatI was walking in the park when I saw her. It was drizzling, and she was sitting on the swing, facing the calm lake that only ever seems to be interrupted by raindrops, umbrella in hand, pushing her feet back and forth ever so slowly. I cautiously approached her, wondering why she is here at a time so late. Everyone calls her an oddball, someone who cannot think straight. The thought of puddles on the ground slipped my mind, and she suddenly spoke, not turning around, voice being so elegant and careful.Why ever are you out here? Alas, have you come to listen to the crickets too?What? I say, taken aback.She pauses as if collecting her thoughts. Or perhaps you are lonely or alone, seeking company?This is one of the things that makes her so different from everyone else, her speech, or rather, way of communicating. And how she pronounced each word delicately. Too proper. Why would I want to socialize at a time so late? I retort, mildly angry at her peacefulness.Alas, you could only be out here at this time for the crickets. However, it is not in my place to know.Why would I be out here for stupid crickets?They are not stupid. Cant you hear their ever so wonderful music? I focus my attention on the chirping of the crickets. It is like music, always having a rhythm.Guess I never thought about it before,You havent? She says in shock, finally turning her head around to meet my eyes. I smile. Her hair bounces against her shoulders in the process, as if being abruptly taken out of their calm trance. Her eyes, pools of chamomile tea. I shake my head no.Why, they sing the most beautiful songs,-she turns back around- I could listen all day, She giggles, putting her hand to her mouth.Whats so funny?Oh, I just had quite a thought. If I were to listen to them sing all day long, I probably would not get anything done. It would rather be a waste of time, dont you think?I wouldnt think it would be a waste of time!

We checked the recliner cushions, under the sofa, we even checked the damn cat bed at one point. After at least 30 minutes of sprawling around like wild animals, nearly tearing the place up like it too, I sat down and bared our loss. Lets just give it a rest and return to this later. Im sure itll show up I suggested.\\tMy bitter wife expressed the most sour disappointing look Ive ever seen. A look an old fashion father would give after learning his son was gay while subsequently sucking a juicy lemon. Way to give up, Gerard! Thats a new one.\\tI returned with a sour face of my own, Whats that supposed to mean?\\tYou know what it means! You always do this and its why nothing ever gets done. Id bet you the freaking house well end up just buying a new remote knowing you!\\tYoure overreacting again. For Christ's sake its just a remote, Kim. Itll turn up soon enough and well both look stupid for making such a big deal about it.\\tKim threw her hands up in disgust before resting them firmly on her hips as if getting comfortable for one of her rants. Look, Ill admit, the remote is a stupid thing. But this isnt just about the remote at this point. Gerard, this last month you have failed to get the car cleaned, to buy Stavros birthday gift and even small things like taking out the trash or feeding the cat. Im getting pissed that youve being so lazy lately\\tI sighed, knowing that was just a small part of her complaints. First of all, Ive been working overtime this week, second of all the car is nearly spotless and third of all, youre just as lazy as me half the time. Those girls nights of yours last hours upon end and all you do is talk about stupid, mind-numbing stuff like work gossip and rom coms. I mean you guys sound like you came right out of desperate housewives in there. Meanwhile our kids rely on me and me alone to see them put to sleep while they wonder why mommy isnt there to tell them a story or even kiss them goodnight\\tYou volunteered for that responsibility, thank you very much! she yipped like a dog far too loud for how small it was, When we got married we agreed to our responsibilities, Im not good with kids and you know that, so you take care of teaching them and all that while I take care of keeping them busy and entertained. Im grateful that you got that part of your job down, but tell me, why cant you feed the animal and take the trash out when you can?!\\tAt that point our argument had derailed in directions they hadnt in months if not years. I hate doing that with her but she always made it so difficult to reason. Maybe you should consider trying. Every think of that? Kids arent exactly a walk in the park to deal with but once you put the effort in you can at least know how to talk to them like a parent should. This is a team effort so why do we have to separate ourselves like this?\\tOh so now you're making this about me being a bad parent? Kims voice peaks with genuine shock, This is about you being sloppy and lazy over simple little things! I do my part so why cant you do yours? I hate having to argue like this as much as you do, but if I dont youll just keep this shit up. Heck, I wouldnt be surprised if this kept happening for months to come knowing you.\\tTaken aback by such a spontaneous situation I sit myself down on our couch. I rest my face into my palms and take a deep, necessary breath. I dont know what your problem is, Kim. But Im not in the mood to argue any more. Can we please just end this and move on with our night. Ill sleep on the fucking couch if you want just please. I hope the kids didnt hear us\\tI hope the kids did! she shouted, They need to know how much of a lazy piece of shit their father is. Maybe then theyll start talking some sense into you too\\tJust like how they need to know their mother is too much of a coward to love them like she should?! Lets sleep this off, Kim. We can talk about this tomorrow. And not yell. Talk\\tKim began making her way towards the stairs, dimly lit by a nightlight in the corner. Her eyes looked as tired as I felt. I knew she hated to argue as much as I did, which still confuses me as to why she starts these things in the first place. I looked away while I could to make our departure less awkward. I found myself a cozy blanket to shelter myself under for the night and fell into an unsettling slumber accompanied by a dream of our life before the kids. Before getting married. Just two young idiots roaming the country for a nice simple life to share. I imagined how happy we were. How comforting and fulfilled we felt when we embraced. A fairly distant memory I find myself missing more often than I feel I should. \\tThe morning finally came after my near endless depressing void of a dream. I quickly folded the blanket and put it back where it belonged so as to not tempt any questions from our very observant boys. The day went by silently and almost agonizing as it was both a weekend and one of my days off. My wife and I didnt share a single word throughout the day. We hardly even saw each other. Halfway through it, I noticed the kitchen trash can was overfilling. I thought back on Kims words from the night prior and almost ignored it out of spite. But I decided to do the hygenic thing and deal with it before it became a bigger problem. A part of me felt great for doing something productive, however a different side of me felt guilt for doing it after our confrontation. It was almost as if I only did it because of the corner I was backed into. I felt humiliated and disheartened. Even so, I continued to do small things around the house such as sweeping the bathroom floors and wiping down the living room coffee table. I hardly felt any better after each courtesy.\\tTrying to keep a level head about it, I made my way through the upstairs hall where our bedrooms are to check on our boys. Each passing room waited emptily as I creeped through. That was until I reached the room at the very end, Stavros room. I peaked in, slowly and cautiously after hearing soft words and giggles. Kim was sitting on Stravros bed, between our sons, talking about possible birthday plans and movies they might want to go see. A warm light thumped in my chest at the sight of it. I hadnt seen my family so close since the boys were toddlers. Kim had a smile far outreaching any she'd ever had. I no longer felt anything negative doing those chores. I think the two of us grew a little bit from our heated argument.\\tSince then, our arguments have been far less common, which isnt to say they dont exist, but Im happy to say our marriage has inched a little closer to how we always envisioned it. Kim has spent much more alone time with the boys and I now have a daily routine for small chores around the house.\\tFunny thing is, the only reason I brought this whole thing up is because I just found that damn remote.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6121507042935321, 'meta': {'name': '45_That Damn Remote.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '905f7a8d515ff22ea3913b51c572a295'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': 'Your husband tells me you cant sleep.I explained to him--Is his name Frank?I explained to Frank that its not that youre not sleeping. Its that youre not sleeping . Youre getting some sleep here and there whether you know it or not. The trouble is that its of no quality. Sleep is like food--theres the good kind and the bad kind. Youre getting potato chip sleep. You need carrot stick sleep. Did you ever show your children the food pyramid when they were younger? Not that its any of my business what you did or didnt show your children. I never had children. I told myself if I was going to have children I would want nine girls. If I couldnt guarantee myself that Id have nine girls, I wouldnt bother at all. So I never bothered. I got a lot of sleep though.Thats just a little joke.My mother used to beg me not to joke. Shed say Crystal, you are my golden child. My gem. My Faberge egg. But you are not funny and never will be.She had a talent for honesty.Now your husband, Frank--Is his name Frank?--Hes at a hotel tonight. Itll just be you and me. I brought some yarn, because Im working on--I work on all kinds of little projects. I hope you dont mind. Im making some blue. Isnt blue a lovely color? Everything I do, I opt for blue. Blue sweaters, blue blankets. I never had enough blue growing up. I didnt see colors until I was fourteen. It broke my heart. Id look at a fresh strawberry and it was no different than looking at a newspaper in terms of the aesthetic. On my fourteenth birthday, I was helping my father fix something on our roof. I had to help him, because both my brothers were scared of heights. I wasnt scared of anything. While I was up there, I felt a dizzy spell come over me. The next thing I know, Im down on the ground. My mother saw me come down right in front of the kitchen window. She screamed bloody murder. The scream was what woke me up. I opened my eyes, and what did I see?Blue.These beautiful blue skies.From that moment on, I could see any color I wanted. My mother and father said it was a miracle. , I thought. Some girl who saw the world as dull and gray could suddenly see maroon and aqua. I thought miracles were supposed to be all about healing those who couldnt walk or saving the souls of the damned. I felt selfish. An entire miracle wasted on me being able to appreciate a blue sky. My mother told me not to question it. Who knows what would happen now that Id been made better? Maybe that meant I was supposed to do something with all these colors I was seeing. Become a painter or a writer of some kind. I never did either, but I did pay attention to the little ways people can be assisted when theyre struggling. When I turned eighteen, I started posting little notices all around my town.Potential meaning--I dont know if I can actually do miracles. It seems to me that if someones had a miracle bestowed upon them, it might have rubbed off a bit.I found out pretty quickly that I have no skill at healing the injured. I cant make ignorant people worldly or hateful people kind. I laid hands on my cousin Sherman, who could never remember anybodys birthday, and his bad memory stayed bad.When I had no luck with people, I tried animal and mineral. The family dog was missing an eye, and no matter how hard I prayed over him, the eye never grew back. Dead plants remained dead. I tried to turn a head of lettuce into a cabbage--a simple enough miracle, I would think. Nothing doing.Its all right, Crystal, my father comforted me as I held the leafy green, I never did like cabbage too much anyhow.It wasnt until my sophomore year of college that I discovered I could do miracles after all. My roommate, Rhonda--I think her name was Rhonda?--She had trouble getting that carrot stick sleep. Shed toss and turn all night. Finally, one night, I said to her, Rhonda, Id like to try and perform a miracle on you, if youre up for that.Rhonda looked at me like I was a talking pentagram, and I guess I dont blame her. She came from a family of atheists and Communists, and people were always trying to show her Jesus in their cornflakes in the mess hall at breakfast. I let her know I wasnt trying for a conversion. Just wanted to contribute to the positive energy of the Universe.The poor thing was so exhausted, I think she would have let Ivan the Terrible sing a lullaby to her if it would have helped. Ivan was probably a better singer than me, so I didnt try anything like that. I just sat across from Rhonda--I think her name was Rhonda. Rhonda or Rhoda like from --I sat across from her and I told her Id be right there, sitting awake, if she felt like sleeping.Now, she must have thought that was the dumbest thing shed ever heard, because what good does somebody sitting across from you do when youre trying to sleep? If anything, it should make you self-conscious, shouldnt it? Somebody staring at you? Eyeballing you while youre trying to give your beleaguered body some respite? But something in my soul told me that was what Rhonda needed, and you know what?She passed out in two minutes flat.Well, once word got out that I could put people to sleep, I was loaded with requests. It turns out college students live and breathe off potato chip sleep, and if I could help get them to the higher plane of REM, theyd have more energy for studying--or partying. Thats how I ended up sitting across from someone every night until they went to sleep. Two minutes was all it took--sometimes less. Nearly all of them offered to pay me, but I wouldnt hear of it. I was so excited to finally have a gift, there was no way I was going to risk losing it by using my ability for selfish reasons.Not to mention the fact that as soon as I found my first gift, my second one came along right behind it. You see, once I started helping other people sleep, I noticed I didnt need any sleep of my own.Oh sure, Id try.As soon as my nightly charge was awash in slumber, Id retire to my own bed--but nothing would happen. Id just lay there. The wild part was that it didnt affect me whatsoever. Every morning Id get out of bed feeling as revived and refreshed as if Id slept like Van Winkle under his tree. I told my doctor about it, and he explained to me in a very slow-moving voice, that I had to be getting sleep. That there was no way I could exist without it. He said Id die if that was the case.That was nearly forty years ago.I havent died. I havent slept. And I can still get anybody to sleep in two minutes or less--free of charge.Once somebody asked me if I miss sleeping. I couldnt lie and say I didnt. I used to have wonderful dreams every night about flying over the great mountain ranges of the world. Soaring through the blue skies--especially once I knew what blue was. Then again, you have to sacrifice if you want to do good in this world. I lose some sleep, and somebody else gains the sleep I lost. Seems like a fair trade to me. And all that extra time comes in handy. For one thing, I always get my taxes done early.Most of the time Im there when somebody wakes up. To see the realization on their faces that theyve been asleep when they thought they were going to be eating potato chips forever? It moves me every time. The doctor who saves your life may be like a god to some people, but the woman who tells you shell be there if you feel like letting yourself go for a few hours so nobody comes along to harm you might just be an angel.Oh yeah, thats how I think of it. Maybe the reason people cant sleep is because we have it conditioned in our bones to never be vulnerable. Never weak. Never at risk of having somebody or something hurt us. So as much as we tell ourselves to give in to rest, another more primal part of us fights back. It might go back to the Stone Age days, I bet. Chances are, nobody got any real sleep until we started sleeping in packs. In communities. One person always stayed up with the fire to make sure nothing bad happened. Even then, I bet some people had a hard time. Why wouldnt they? Good sleep is a matter of trust. Its hard to trust these days.Some people think of me as a kind of Sleeping Angel, but I dont see it that way at all. I just think something about me is easy to trust, and this is one of the benefits. You see me sit down across from you, and that part of your brain thats been keeping you up says--The next thing you know, youre flying through those blue skies just like I used to do.Ill admit its not much of a miracle, but--Oh, would you look at that.And I didnt even have time to sit down.Well, some are easier than others, I suppose.Better go call--Frank?Is it Frank?You know what?Never mind.Ill ask you when you wake up.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6078141139298565, 'meta': {'name': '58_Nothing But Blue Skies.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'ef0e2807c4fc7332323cd8b8f2663772'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': 'The first time I saw her I was freshly 16; my birthday is in September, so it was the first week of school and I was completely drained. I was having some banal dream about being a volunteer at a shelter, but the shelter was full of unicorns or whatever. I dont remember what task I was doing in this random fantasy, but I remember I saw her on the other side of the yard. She was wearing a blue shirt and her hair was in a ponytail. She looked distressed and out of place. And she was in color. Its hard to verbalize, but I almost always dream in muted shades. Not in black and white or even gray, but just in a duller world, like a painting thats been left in the sun. She was practically neon, so vibrant she looked saturated. It was disorienting, to say the least, and I woke up in a cold sweat. I felt unsettled yet strangely comforted. Something inside me recognized her, something I wasnt yet in tune with. This part of me, however hidden and however irrelevant, cracked open and screamed at me viciously. It screamed in a way that I could not hear myself think, I could not try to read, and I could absolutely could not go back to sleep. After that night I didnt sleep for more than 4 hours at a time. I was terrified to see her again so I avoided dreaming altogether, but I couldnt maintain this state of living for more than a week. Eventually I passed out on the couch from sheer exhaustion and fell into a 12-hour sleep paralysis. It was then that she reappeared.                                 --------------------------------- Hello?Even her voice is colorful. Im in a white void, but everytime she speaks rainbows oscillate above in patterns like the Northern lights.Yeah, hello?Im scared absolutely shitless, but Im also paralyzed so I decide to act confident. Its not like I can fight back anyways.They said I should look for you?The rainbow glimmers with more intensity.What? Who are you?Im Steph? From The Department?Department? Department of what?Yes, The Department of What. Exactly.The rainbow seems to sigh with satisfaction.No, what?Yes, what. Also when, why, and how. Not who though. Thats the OtherSide.Are you the lady from the shelter? With the blue shirt?Yes! Yes, thats me! Oh, Im so glad you remember. Sometimes people forget.And your name is Steph?Well...sure. Im sorry, I just realized I never solidified. How rude.And just like that, in both an instant and an eternity, the rainbow caves into itself and forms a human female. She looks exactly like the shelter woman, but minus the ponytail and shes wearing a floral dress. An ugly floral dress. God, its hideous.Okay. Hi, Steph. I reach out my hand for her to shake.Hi, Andy. Its a pleasure. She has a lovely smile and a firm handshake, but I cant stop looking at the dress. It looks like my grandmas curtain.Can you explain please?I was no longer panicking, for some reason. It was like touching her hand has infused me with heroin; Im totally at peace.Oh, of course, dear. So like I said, Im from The Department of What, When, Why, and How. Im our customer service rep. She smiles.Oh.I understand youre confused. However, all of your questions will be answered shortly. Just follow me, please.She starts to walk along the whiteness and I realize we are in a box. Shes walking towards a small door at the edge, but its not really a door, actually. Its just a translucent curtain.Right through here, please. She smiles again and touches my shoulder, and the heroin feeling comes back.Suddenly Im in a conference room at a...a Hilton hotel, yes. It has grey chairs and a rectangular desk and harshly dim lighting that gives me a headache. You guys normally seem comfortable here. Steph has changed into a sleek power suit with a slicked-back bun. She matches the vibe perfectly, and it does make me feel strangely at peace. I guess we humans do crave comfort.Please, have a seat. We havent got much time.I pull up a chair and realize Im wearing a suit too, but mine is much less crisp. I glance at the surrounding glass and see that I look exhausted.Why do I look so crappy?I dont know, dear, its based on your aura. I think you need to relax. Anyways, lets begin.A whiteboard appears in front of her, along with a girl my age in pink pajamas. The girl is upright, sleeping, and quite beautiful. I think she looks like that girl from Bring It On, the leader of the Clovers.Okay. This is Bella. The name Bella appears on the whiteboard behind Steph in pink cursive, and I somehow know that its in Bellas handwriting.Bella is your soulmate, so to speak. I hate how you humans have gentrified that word. It has an actual meaning beyond physical life.Shes my soulmate? I glance back at the stunning girl in the pink pajamas and cant refrain from smiling.Yes. She is, and Ill let you get acquainted in a little bit.Steph shifts uncomfortably, which makes all the chairs change colors. Shes talking too fast, and I get a bad feeling.What?Well, Im here because...well, this is just so difficult to explain. There are some people with souls, essences, spirits, whatever you want to call it that just mesh. Like theyre meant to be together. ButBut what?My heart sinks. Bella twitches.Well, you just cant be together in the physical realm.Why not?Your corporal forms and cognitive minds and all that junk dont mesh well. Based on our calculations, youd probably marry, be miserable, and have a brutal divorce that would haunt your two kids forever. Theres also a statistically significant chance youd murder each other. A bunch of numbers and images appear on the board behind her, but I dont really notice.Its extremely rare this happens, Andy. Less than one in a billion. But when it does, The Department tries to give you an opportunity to be together in some way. So heres our offer: you two can dream together, 8 hours a day but no more, and do whatever you want. Other than that, you may not attempt to contact each other, speak to each other, or anything of the sort.I think about what the consequences would be if I did.They will be grave. Obviously she can fucking read minds. I pause and try to make my mind go blank.I agree.Steph freezes.Does she?Steph blinks.Does Bella?Bella agreed a couple weeks ago. Weve been waiting for you. I tried to contact you before, but your dreams move very rapidly. It makes it hard to travel.Can I meet her?Andy, I have to warn you that once you meet her, you will fall madly in love with her. She will consume your every moment for the eight hours a day that you sleep, but after that, you will have no memory of her. Shell fade into your mind just like every other dream. Are you sure thats what you want?And I cant explain it, but in that moment I know that it is exactly what I want. 8 hours a day is a third of my life, and looking at Bella I know she is worth it.Yes. Its what I want.Okay. Here you go.The room dissipates into air along with Steph, and me and Bella are left standing in the white void. Shes awake now, and I see that her eyes are honey colored.Hi. Her voice is like music.Hi, Bella.Call me Belly.She grabs my hand and walks towards the edge of the void, moving towards something I cant quite see. Yet somehow, just like her, I know its there.                       ---------------------------------------- My wife and I are in a diner celebrating my 52nd birthday. Its close to our house, and with the kids off at college we have plenty of time to go out now. I dont love breakfast for dinner, but its her favorite thing, so Ill go with it. Shes devouring a plate of chocolate chip waffles like its her last meal, but my omelet is kind of gross so I leave it alone.Anyways, Deborah was saying that Sally and Ron are considering divorce. But, you know, theyre old parents. Like, their kid is still only eight, Andy. Imagine what a divorce would do to an eight year old.Yeah, I cant imagine it doing any good.Im not paying much attention, but she doesnt seem to notice.So anyways, theyre fighting all the time, and their kid told the teacher, who call..  Everything trails off. The world goes blank and all I see is a beautiful woman walking by the window. She looks like shes about my age, maybe a bit younger. Shes talking on the phone with someone, and I can tell by her face that its a pleasant conversation. Shes wearing a winter jacket even though its 70 degrees. Her face is kind. She has a mole by her lower lip. I can just tell she knows Im staring at her, but she doesnt seem to mind. Like shes done it a million times, she looks at me. Not past me or through me, but at me. I look back. Her eyes are honey-colored. Something inside me clicks. Baby? I turn towards my wife and watch the world come back, and when I look back at the window shes gone. Honey, where did you go? She has syrup all over her chin.Oh, I just thought I saw someone I knew.Who? Im unsure of how to answer that question, so I take a bite of my omelette and stare at the spot where my perfect woman just was.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6077024886799024, 'meta': {'name': '139_Souls, Spirits, Whatever You Call It.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '401e3d20e1200a203343c12b9f77bdec'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': 'Playing Hearts It has been years, and I think about you all the time. My imagination runs wild about us being together. We have never had a date, nor you have barely spoken to me. We are in the same class and live in the same neighborhood. You must know who I am because everyone else does. It is a hot sunny day. I m driving in my red-hot convertible with white leather seat covers. The DJ on the radio said, If you really have someone you want to get next to, this is for you. I start singing I want to get next to you! Oohs wee that was one of my jams! The DJ play just my imagination next! Man, DJ must be feeling me today! I was thinking about Ken! Ken was someone who I have known since childhood. I used to sit on the bench and watch him play basketball. I became a cheerleader because I wanted to be close to him. I had the craziest crush ever! After every game, I would walk pass him and wink my eyes. Ken will smile and watch me walk away. That smile made my body shiver all over. A spirit will flow from the top of my head to the crown of my feet. Wetness came across my lips. I felt his gentle kiss press upon my lips. I felt his presence covering my body like an angel wing. Horns are blowing at me. I start to laugh at myself. It was time I came back to reality! My imagination was running wild! The next day I went to the school picnic, and Ken was there holding this girl hands. I was crushed! Carol ran up to me putting her arms around me saying, Girl hold your head up! You need to stop procrastinating and step up to the plate. I took a step back and look at Carol saying, You right! Either Im going to do something about it or leave it alone. I will come up with something! Carol said, Now lets go have some fun! We had a volleyball game, but we had to pick team captains. Of course, I was one, and the girl Ken was with was the other captain. Now how ironic was that! Thank you, God! I was first to pick a team member! Now you know I had to pick Ken! Oh! By the way Ken girl name is Morgan. Morgan stood there with her hands on her hips looking with daggers in her eyes. I did not connect eyes with her because I wanted to stay focus on the game. Let the game begin! Ken had first serve. He hit the ball near Morgan. Morgan ran and hit the ball near me, and I had to jump high to pitch it back over. It was almost there but it bounced back. Ken ran took a leap and pitch it over the net. I was breathing hard but at the same time I said, Good job baby! Ken smile at me and wink his eyes. I start to blush until all my dimples came out. Carol was laughing, and I look at her with rolling eyes. Carol said, Now the universe seen that! If Morgan did not know how you feel, she knows now! You should have seen the way she had looked at you! Later that night we sat around the campfire, I made sure I was sitting directly across Ken. We had to pass the wand and tell our most passion imagination. This was my moment for Ken to not only feel the deepest of my heart but to know the lovable part of me. I took a deep breath. I know a person whom I really like to know me and vice a versa. I am not a hard person to please. If you give me a candy bar with a love note attach, you will catch my heart. Always respect me, and I will make you feel like the King of an Island. I was breathing passionately. Before you have approach me than you will know I am yours. Your spirit will mingle with mind. We can walk everywhere, and people will know we are made as one. We can enjoy each other without always having other friends to be in our present.I slightly look at Ken wondering if he felt my heart. Did Ken know I was talking about him? This is the last straw! The only way to kick off this crush is to finally ask him out! Winter had kick in and I went on a skiing trip. Do not know how to ski but this was something I always wanted to do. Ken did not go on the trip but that is fine. It is not like we were dating. It whines up me having an accident while I was taking lessons. It was bad enough for me to lay up for six months. I had Carol to keep tab on Ken and Morgan. Finally, they broke up! Morgan was caught with a football player. I was so happy I kick my legs forgotten they were in a cast. The door was open for me! The big day has arrived! It is Carol birthday, and her parties always a celebrity jam! I knew tonight was the night I had to ask Ken out! I had to find out if we were meant to be together. I had this crush for five years, and it is time to proceed or let it go! Carol is trying to call me. I know what she wants. Rita, I know you are going to dress for perfection. So, are you going to make a move on him? Rita replies, Yes I am. I am going to finally ask him out for a date. The only problem is getting him alone. Carol said, Do not worry about that! I got you girl! All I could think of is Ken dancing with me holding me tight and glazing into my eyes. I need to look my best! Carol and I had a day of beauty. We had massage, facial, pedicure and manicure. We went to pick-up her dress, and I bought me some shoes.  I kept practicing what should I say to Ken. How was I going to ask him out on a date! Will he accept my invitation? Darn cannot mess this up!  Carol came to pick me up in her limo. We had a birthday toast and talk about how our night will be a success. We could hear the music before entering the hall. I let her enter first because it was her night to shine. My eyes wonder around the room and did not spot Ken. I mingle, had a few cocktails and dance. It was 11:00 and still no Ken! I ran to the ladies room to keep from crying. Carol follows me in the ladys room. Rita do not get upset said Carol. You look too pretty. Besides, you will turn ugly. We both start to laugh. This was to be my night, and it looks like Im not going to have it Carol! Let us go back to your party. I dont want to spoil your special day. We heard Reggae and ran to the dance floor. Reggae is a rhythm that makes you move sexy. As I was moving across the floor, Ken was standing in the middle of the crowd. My heart start to beat more than the rhythm. Carol dance towards me and whisper do not lose your cool. The DJ said grab a partner. So slowly I dance towards Ken and took his hands. I put on the sexiest moves on him ever and manage to stay a lady. I look over at Carol, and she was smiling giving me the thumbs up!  After the dance I ask Ken if I could by him a drink, and he said yes. During our conversation, I ask Ken if I can take him out on a date. Ken starts to laugh and said, You always ask men you dont know out on a date.No! I have always wanted to go out with you. I have been watching you for a long time, and always like what I seen. Silly to say you are my crush. Ken starts to blush Why I dont know you? Stop playing! I was a cheerleader for the basketball game. You were on my volleyball team. We had to give our most passionate moment at the campfire, and you caught my eyes. Sometimes I walk pass you on occasions and you have winked your eyes. Cannot believe you do not know me! Oh! forgot I had to disappear for six months because of a leg injury. Ken had this serious look on his face asking, Sorry I need to ask when we actually met? Rita replied, You mean after all these years you have never known my name! I was looking disappointed and feeling embarrassed. Guess we have not met. We knew the same people and always been in the same environment.  Ken said, After being my fan all these years, and you are a sexy dancer maybe we can be friends. Hi, my name is Ken. My name is Rita. Would you like to go on a date? Ken smile and said, I will like that very much. The doors open and I heard Angels singing. Finally, I will be going out with my crush. If things go as I have imagination, my crush will be bigger, better, and. I will leave you with an imagination.
