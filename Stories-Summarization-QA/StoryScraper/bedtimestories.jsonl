I try to tell her that I am grateful. \"I even collected the spiders (with a vacuum using your lingerie,) See?\"\nShe wants to see the jar where I put the spiders. It's a Vlassic jar that once housed salt, garlic, \"natural spices\" and pickles. \"That's good. That's very fine work, Lester.\"\nI left little air holes.\nShe takes me to the bathroom and adds bubbles. A rubber ducky comes out and we squeeze it together. For a minute, our hands clasp and we squeeze the yellow duck into a small and deformed version of himself. The yellow rubber ducky continues to smile and wifey goes for a fresh towel.\nI scrub behind the ears like a big boy. I'm not afraid to get my hair wet and lean back to where the water comes over.\n\u00a0\"Does Lester need to make a boom boom?\"\nI get it. Can't quite control the things my mouth says and how my body moves. I'm in a head aquarium and just tapping on glass. It's a shock value for the body. Like the muscles and speech simply will go away. Just go away.\nMargarett has those hollow eyes, the ones that saw God in the night and can't explain the meeting on the hill. Or else she's sleepless. The Army pays better for bereavement and lost limbs. They can't quite put a number on Shell Shock. Her head is thicker than mine. I feel like floating.\nThere is no romance left when I try to pitch forward. A Registered Nurse for this situation is not on the menu. My dad said he would drive up from Arizona and do the duty. If I could feel it, I would want to die.\nHow does coffee still smell in the morn? Does it pry through the places that get hard in the night? Does it warm the gullet or scald the smile? I can't remember. Margarett is on double strength.\nFor fun, we drive over to the Veteran Affairs hospital at least twice a week. Since the national discussion of free health care and Hilary, I'm told that the Army doctors have gotten better. Don't know. No point of comparison for me. I got my Shell Shock late in life, 24.\nI think it's been five years but everyone has the same amount of candles after the cake\u00a0starts looking like a battlefield. Those twisty yellow, red and white swirled candles? They look like dead guys that don't know they're dead. Half the people in combat who get shot actually stand for a few breaths of air. Some forget they were just candles and try to flicker.\nThe body is robust. The body is infinitely capable.\nMargaret passes me the remote but I am literally too stupid to realize if I want Sesame Street or the Wall Street Journal. Thoughts come later after the feelings. The mind needs time to adjust. The arms and legs do what they want to do. Sometimes I look like a happy seal just flapping.\nViktor Frankl once got random people on his therapist's couch and asked: \"Why don't you kill yourself?\"\nHe didn't hand them a gun or a knife He wasn't asking them if they were failures. Instead, he cut through the years of self-pity and asked 'What do you need to do in this life?'\nWake.\nI need to get out of this encasement, the fog, the \"L\" word. \"la.t..\" lad-n... latency? Yes. That is the correct word because someone said it aloud. Some time ago.\nI will remember my muscles\nI will complete all the stretches\nI will suck up any complications\nI will take care of her. My Margaret.\nI will\n*\nBaby like? Baby-ism. That \"I\" word is long. (\n) That's me, a second round as a three years old. If Margaret could get the good times again, I know she would see the beauty in our arrangement. She always wanted kids.\nI'd take her dancing. She'd put her hand in my hand, instead of my hand in her pocket. We'd hit that prom-styled dance floor and just ignore everyone else. She'd look up into my eyes. She'd look up. To my eyes.\n*\nIt's really not Margaret's fault that she is a single mother wife. Like a good soldier she waited 4 years.\nIn fact, she still waits. The men have to come to the door because\u00a0\nRegistered nurses do not babysit at $6 an hour.\u00a0\nI think she's found a steady. He sells Oldsmobile and wants nothing to do with war. I like that he brings over Flowers, even if they are from a convenience store. My wife adjusts the volume to the television to be very loud.\nLoud is very good in this situation. Though it's only so pleasant to hear the familiar creak of the box springs.. someone is getting life.\nI am just so grateful when sleep comes. Even if there is a howling, tensive, anger \u2014 I know that Margaret will stop *whatever* she's doing. Because that's what a single mother wife has to do.\nShe rocks me to sleep and still waits 20 minutes to make sure it takes. She smells like a girl again.

{"title": "Noctuary", "story": "Damian sat with his legs dangling over the edge of the rocking deck of the ship, holding onto the lower rung of the metal railing and gazing at the horizon. The waning sunset was a blaze of glorious color, the drifting clouds purple against the red western sky, with the swells of the Atlantic ocean sapphire-blue beneath. The old adage r\n bobbed to the surface of his thoughts.\u00a0\nAs stars materialized in the darkling eastern sky, Damian headed below deck, occasionally steadying himself with the rails lining the narrow hallways and stairs of the \n. If the weather stayed clear, both of his parents would be busy tomorrow. He'd left them doing their preparation checks to watch the sunset before going to bed.\nWhen he reached his deck, something was wrong. The hallway beyond the stairs was dark; the overhead lights weren\u2019t even flickering. Strange. Too bad he didn\u2019t have a flashlight with him.\u00a0\nRunning a hand along the wall, Damian counted doors until he reached the cabin he was sharing with his mom. He left the door open as he went in, but it didn't help. The light from the stairwell didn\u2019t reach this far, and the walls were devoid of windows.\nEnvisioning his path to the drawers under the lower bunk, he fumbled forward, intending to find his headlamp\u2014until the ship pitched, and his shin slammed into something. Damian staggered a few steps, then doubled over in pain, groaning and hissing through his teeth, blind in the dark.\nSomething clammy wrapped around his bare ankle.\u00a0\n\u201cYAAAGH!\u201d He jumped, collided with something hard, and fell to the floor. Footsteps approached in the hallway, and a light flashed in his face.\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d The light pointed down, and he could see who was holding it. Nicholas Bradshaw, Dad\u2019s friend. An octopus scientist\u2014what was the word Dad used? Teuthologist. His brown beard looked like a pirate captain\u2019s. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nRubbing his head, the teenager said, \u201cSomething grabbed my ankle.\u201d\nNicholas knelt beside the bunks, his flashlight playing across the drawers. One was open, and something red was hanging out of it. The red thing squirmed in the light.\u00a0\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d he exclaimed, pulling the drawer farther open. \u201cHere's the monster under your bed!\u201d he said, glancing at Damian with a grin.\nDamian peered over the burly man\u2019s shoulder. At first, he couldn\u2019t comprehend what he was seeing. A writhing, slithering mass of thick, red tendrils spotted with white flowed around the inside of the drawer. Then a bulbous head that looked as big as his own reared up. An octopus. He shuddered and took a step back. \u201cWhat a monster!\u201d\n\u201cKraken\u2019s a big guy, but he\u2019s hardly a monster. He\u2019s not even full-grown yet.\u201d Nicholas began gathering the octopus into a bundle, scooping its tentacles together even as they spilled out like water. Frustrated after several fruitless attempts to corral it with one hand, he looked up at Damian and held out the flashlight. \u201cWould you mind helping me?\u201d\nDamian took it, and watched as his dad\u2019s friend lifted the octopus into the air, higher and higher. The snaking appendages with their constellation-like pattern of white spots seemed never-ending. It had to be at least a yard long.\u00a0\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d Nicholas grunted, still trying to cradle all of the arms as he went out the door.\u00a0\nDamian complied, pointing the flashlight around and ahead of the teuthologist and his charge. Walking along the hall, he noticed a wet trail on the floor.\u00a0\nFinally, Nicholas turned aside through an open door, into a room with a large fish tank on a low table. There were no fish swimming in it.\u00a0\n\u201cCould you take the lid off? And\u2014\u201d the man clutched at the octopus\u2014Kraken\u2014as it oozed out of his arms. \u201cSorry, he\u2019s a handful. Will you help me put him back into the tank?\u201d\nDamian lifted the lid and set it on a table. He put the flashlight down, balancing it on its thick handle so it pointed at the ceiling. He didn\u2019t want to touch the octopus, but it probably wasn\u2019t good for it to be out like this if it lived in the water. He came close, hesitantly stretching his hands out. Would he hurt it?\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold his mantle, you support his legs, okay? Don\u2019t squeeze them.\u201d\nDamian tried not to flinch as the undulating arms came in contact with his skin. They felt strange. Soft but strong as they wrapped around his own arms, the suckers tickling slightly.\u00a0\n\u201cIn we go!\u201d Nicholas heaved the floppy head up and over the edge of the aquarium, Damian just a little slower on his end. The octopus sank slowly to the bottom, arms outspread. It was a dark, saturated shade of red, with white spots swirling across its body like living stars. As Damian watched, the red changed, turning paler, with more orange in it, like the sky before he\u2019d come below. Kraken was less startling now, and didn\u2019t seem so monstrous. Only\u2026different. Not the same as him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cPhew! Thanks for your help.\u201d Nicholas replaced the lid. \u201cYou\u2019re Damian, right? Roberto\u2019s kid?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Flipping a light switch up and down, Damian asked, \u201cWhy do you think the power\u2019s out?\u201d\nNicholas grinned. \u201cKraken did it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! How?\u201d\n\u201cSee that tube there, coming out the bottom of his head? That\u2019s his siphon. He squirts water out of it to swim, but he can also squirt it into the air. Look.\u201d Nicholas grabbed the flashlight and pointed it up at the light fixtures, then down at the floor. Damian could see the puddle beneath.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s done it before,\u201d Nicholas continued, \u201cbut I thought I\u2019d outsmarted him with the tank lid this time. I guess I didn\u2019t.\u201d He put the top back on the aquarium. \u201cAre you helping your parents with the ROVs?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not eighteen yet, so some other people don\u2019t want me on the back deck. They think I\u2019ll just be in the way during the deployments and retrievals.\u201d He watched Kraken stream out of sight under a rock in the tank.\n\"Would you be interested in helping me take care of Kraken? More people engaging with him will keep him from getting bored, and then he'll hopefully stop looking for his own fun.\"\n\"Sure. I wouldn't mind.\"\nFrom the way Damian was staring, mesmerized, at Kraken, Nicholas had an inkling that the Callistoctopus macropus would be getting a lot more attention in the near future."}
{"title": "Behind Closed Doors", "story": "\u201cGo brush your teeth, honey.\u201d Red and swollen were her eyes as she said it, her smile sad, her fingers digging into the supple flesh of his arms harder than she had intended to. He didn\u2019t blame her, but he did flinch out of her grip and slipped his sleeve in his mouth, chewing. \u201cMama will be up in a couple minutes.\u201d Nodding, he clenched his jaw and traveled up the stairs, climbed one step at a time until the fabric of his pajama was wet in his mouth. Focusing on the sounds he made helped; stepping stool scraping against the bathroom tiles, tap water running, bristles brushing against baby teeth, spitting and rinsing. He had gotten better at it\u2014the ignoring. It was like background TV noise now, sort of, loud and garbled as the morning channels that told adult-only news on endless loops. He didn\u2019t really like those, just like he didn\u2019t like this, but he\u2019d picked up the habit of tuning it out. Mama had taught him.\n\tSweetie brushed past him as he flushed the toilet, her tail looping around his leg and her purr an open-ended question. She hated it too, she made sure to remind him of it with that look in her eyes, like a fishing line thrown for prey, its hook ready to grasp and hold on for dear life. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d the look asked him. \u201cJust ignore it, Sweetie. We just have to ignore it.\u201d He stroked the soft fur of her head, but she ran off into the direction of her litter box. Stray pebbles of substrate stuck to his socks, he shook them off then watched Sweetie as she whined and circled her box, full to the brim yet odorless to the trained nose. He suddenly wished Sweetie\u2019s box could be swirled down the drain, just like him and Mama and Pop did. Much easier to clean. \u201cSorry, Sweetie.\u201d He left her wide-eyed and hanging and stumbled over to his room\u2014\n, \n, \n.\n\tHe wasn\u2019t really sleepy, but he jumped on his bed and made a cocoon of his covers regardless. Sleep always blurred the sounds, like cotton balls humming in his ears or fairies flapping their wings until he got dizzy and fell backwards into another land. He\u2019d once tried to describe it to Mama\u2014could they maybe meet down there at night, among the butterflies and the dragons and the woodland critters?\u2014but she seemed to be a stranger to its magic. He wished he could bring her along to escape when things got too loud.\n\tSuddenly, three knocks came from under his bed.\n\tIn an instant he was made of marble, ear taut, dreading the greasy cough that might follow. Pop couldn\u2019t have come in here while he was busy brushing his teeth, could he? It couldn\u2019t have been more than five minutes from the time he left the living room, ten, tops. Although, he had been so focused on ignoring\u2014heavy steps up the stairs and into his bedroom easily could have been missed.\n\tHe didn\u2019t want to look.\n\tThe images of what happened last time he looked still fogged his mind and fueled his nightmares.\n\tAnd if Pop was in here, then where was Mama?\n\tThe fear grew thicker and hogged all of his air. He began panting softly, loud enough for anyone inside the room to pick up on. The cotton balls that belonged to the Sleep Lord had flown away like clouds in the sky, or in his case, hand-painted on the ceiling. His little fists clung to the bed sheet as if it were armor. Hard, made of iron, casted by the village\u2019s most renowned blacksmith.\n\t\u201cPsst.\u201d\n\tHe twitched. He didn\u2019t know that voice, but it sure wasn't Pop\u2019s. Maybe he could afford a glimpse? One quick peek under the bed frame?\n\t\u201cPsst, under here.\u201d\n\tThe voice seemed friendly, friendlier than Pop\u2019s, maybe not quite on Mama\u2019s level. He emerged from his nest and slowly hung his upper body over the edge. His handful of blond hair bent the knee to gravity and blood rose to his head.\n\tHe blinked\u2014the glow from his knightly nightlight didn\u2019t quite reach these particular netherlands\u2014and waited with patience unbefitting of his age. Then, he saw it. A pair of eyes, larger than his own, round and dilated, shining in the darkness. He gasped and clamped a hand to his mouth, his heart drifting down to his throat.\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t eat you,\u201d the creature said, its pearly white teeth shining like razor blades. \u201cI\u2019m here to keep an eye on you.\u201d\n\tGradually, the beating in his gut subsided. \u201cOn me?\u201d He moaned, glancing to the doorway. \u201cB-but, have I done something bad?\u201d\n\t\u201cOh, nothing of the sort, little one.\u201d Its smile curled high. \u201cLet me rephrase that: I\u2019m here to protect you. Keep you safe. Help.\u201d\n\tHis head was starting to hurt from the pressure of the angle, so he drew free of the covers and crouched down to face the creature, his feet warm against the sticky floor. \u201cBut\u2026 Mama protects me.\u201d\n\tThe creature nodded.\n\t\u201cShe does, but her strength is beginning to falter.\u201d\n\tHe thought for a second, confused. \u201cIs Mama hurting?\u201d\n\tAgain, it nodded, its blue eyes turning an unpleasant shade of yellow, its pupils narrowing. \u201cShe is. She has been for a while, but I think you know that. Listen to me, little one\u2014you cannot ignore it forever.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut Mama says it\u2019s best to ignore, always ignore.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat she says matters little.\u201d The eyes burned a deep orange, like simmering flames. \u201cYou know what needs to be done, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\tHe licked his lips nervously, playing with the hardened skin that protruded around his fingernails. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\t\u201cYou hate Pop, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d He was quick to shout. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\t\u201cLying is futile, little one.\u201d\n\tThis silence was the loudest thing he\u2019d ever heard. Louder than Pop\u2019s anger, than the fire alarm triggered by Uncle Joe\u2019s cooking, than Mama\u2019s screams, than even his dreams. There was nothing else he could hear, but this silence.\n\t\u201cAre you\u2026 a dragon?\u201d He asked the creature.\n\tIts tongue came out, forked and pink like a snake\u2019s. \u201cThat is for you to decide, little one. Now,\u201d Suddenly its hand came forward, retreating an object which had been ignored, left to the world of dust and forgotten things. \u201cIt is time.\u201d\n\tSlowly, he accepted the sharp object\u2014from a skin of scales to human flesh. Deep down, this all made sense, and he found himself nodding as the creature\u2019s eyes turned a deep crimson.\n\t\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\tAfter tonight, Mama\u2019s tears would be no more. She would be nothing but smiles, and laughs, and kisses. She would follow him into the night land and see it all with her own eyes, the magic, the fairies and the dragons.\u00a0\n\tIn his little hand, the knife sang as it tasted blood.\n "}
{"title": "Butterscotch the Brave", "story": "\tNot so long ago and not so far away there lived a knight: Butterscotch the Brave. At first glance, he appeared unimpressive and his only defining features were his namesake butterscotch-coloured curls. He was not particularly muscly, nor was he exceptionally tall (in fact, he was slightly shorter than average), but his loyalty and big heart were second-to-none - matched only by his bravery. The night Butterscotch\u2019s bravery was born began in a place few would expect: a child\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0\n \n\tIn the quiet dark of her bedroom atop her messy blankets sat Bella, a scared, wide-eyed girl of about six years old. She was woken from her slumber by a slow, uneven scratching sound beneath her bed. From his vantage point on the floor, Butterscotch thought he saw a shadow - blacker than black - shift beneath the bed frame. Focusing on it instead of the girl, he watched for any more signs of movement and was oblivious to the girl\u2019s shudders.\u00a0\n \n\tNothing moved for a long time, and the only sounds Butterscotch could hear were his friend\u2019s shaky and shallow breaths. He was tired and glanced at Bella before his eyelids began to droop. Then, a barely noticeable, shadowy tentacle poked out from beneath the bed and began snaking its way up her mattress. The girl\u2019s mouth opened in voiceless terror as more of the monster emerged silently from its hiding place. It towered above Bella as she sank back into the corner of her bed and tried to hide beneath her covers. In the thin beams of moonlight that shone through her blinds, she could see multiple tentacles and a large head full of razor-sharp teeth and multiple deep yellow slits for eyes.\u00a0\n \n\tButterscotch hadn\u2019t started dreaming yet when he heard a small whimper from the bed. He jolted awake and his eyes widened in alarm when he realized what he was staring at. He had heard about shadow monsters; they preyed on children\u2019s fear until they grew big enough and solid enough to be seen in the daylight - and by then, they were nearly impossible to stop.\u00a0\n \n\tRising quickly to his feet, he scanned the room for anything he could use to fight the monster, until his eyes landed on the toy sword he had seen Bella playing with earlier in the day. He raced towards it, hoping that a toy sword would be strong enough to defeat a shadow monster. Butterscotch reached for it and watched in amazement as the toy blade became a real one when he picked it up.\u00a0\n \n\tAs the monster turned to face Bella and Butterscotch turned to face the monster, he saw several fluffy somethings catapulted off of the last tentacle the shadowy figure pulled out from under the bed. To his surprise, when the tiny clumps of dust landed, they looked like bunnies.\n \n\tThe dust bunnies regrouped to form a new plan of attack when one called out to Butterscotch, \u201cAre you with us or against us?\u201d\n \n\tButterscotch blinked. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing - or hearing. Dust bunnies were real?!\n \n\tGlancing from the monster to the bunnies, he replied, \u201cI\u2019m with whoever will help me protect my friend from the monster.\u201d\n \n\tThe top bunny (also known as the bunny in charge) responded, \u201cLet us help. We can distract it!\u201d\n \n\tThe bunnies huddled, then spread out. Their plan was simple: rush the shadow monster. Springing into action, the dust bunnies charged across the floor, yelling at the top of their tiny lungs. Joined by reinforcements from under the bed as they approached the looming shadow, the rapidly multiplying critters swarmed the shadow, and crawled up its towering body. It wasn\u2019t until they reached its shoulders that the monster noticed them and turned away from Bella, who was as white as a sheet.\u00a0\n \n\tButterscotch saw his chance and took it. He raced toward the nearest tentacle, sword held high, and swung when he reached it, cutting off part of a tentacle. The monster let out a low, surprised growl and turned to face its attacker. As he watched the menacing figure before him, Butterscotch barely had time to brace himself before a different tentacle sent him flying. He landed with a hard thud and scrambled to his feet, ready to attack, but the monster was distracted now, and trying to dislodge the dust bunnies that desperately clung to it.\n \n\tSome of the bunnies that fell to the floor ran to Butterscotch, and the littlest one spoke up in a tiny voice, \u201cSir, you don\u2019t have any armour to protect you! We can help you!\u201d\u00a0\n \n\tBefore Butterscotch could react, he was covered in dust bunnies that morphed into armour. He didn\u2019t think armour made of dust could be very strong, but when another tentacle slammed into him, he stayed standing and hardly felt a thing. Fighting the shadow monster would be easy now!\n \n\tSwinging his sword once again, Butterscotch charged the monster, and again, he cut off a tentacle. The shadow shrieked in pain - and shrunk. Every time Butterscotch hit the shadow with his sword or cut off another tentacle, it shrank, until it was not much bigger than the top dust bunny. At that point, the monster realized it was beaten, and it slithered up the wall and out the window before it was hit again.\n \n\tA cacophony of tiny cheers erupted from the army of dust bunnies, and Butterscotch\u2019s armour morphed back into more dust bunnies. He smiled and looked at Bella on her bed, and she looked more amazed than scared now. Slowly, the girl crawled to the edge of her bed and stepped onto the floor. Then, she ran towards Butterscotch and hugged him. The sword fell to the floor and became a regular toy again when Bella picked Butterscotch up, crushing him in her arms.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cYou\u2019re the best teddy bear ever, Butterscotch!\u201d she squealed in delight. She was still beaming when she looked down at the dust bunnies and said, \u201cAnd I am never cleaning under my bed again!\u201d\n "}

{"title": "Green Crumbs", "story": "A pale 17-year-old boy rests his elbows on the glass table-top in front of him and leans forward to stare down a basket of fried wonton strips. The container is made of shiny metal, with nothing separating the polished steel surface from the hot, greasy, chunks of crisped wheat.\n \nThom furrows his brow as he counts the individual dough pimples still sizzling on the outer layer of each one. The juxtaposition makes him queasy. Steam rises from the pile and beads of oil begin to accumulate below. He knows condensation will soon challenge each strip\u2019s structural integrity, and the certainty of that outcome throws Thom into the early stages of panic. His shoulders and neck tense up. His jaw clenches. He squeezes his eyes shut and tries to make the basket go away.\n \nThe room is cold, so cold that its intensity burns Thom\u2019s nostrils as he inhales deeply. His exhale pours from his mouth like plumes of smoke into the thin, dry air.\n \nThe chill penetrates his feet, until it reaches down inside the bones. He knows that\u2019s when hypothermia starts. He\u2019ll feel relief from the ache and the sting once his lower extremities go numb, but once he starts losing feeling, that\u2019s when it gets harder and harder to thaw out.\n \nHe turns his head to the right and opens his eyes, doing his best to keep the table absent from his field of view. A woman by the register at the front of the restaurant holds a phone receiver to her ear and nods slowly while her other hand massages her forehead. Wisps of dark hair spill through her kneading fingers as she grimaces, then sighs.\n \n\u201cNo, you cannot order the Tom Kha Gai soup to go,\u201d she explains over the phone. \u201cYou just can\u2019t, OK? I don\u2019t know why. You just can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \nEmotionally charged but muffled chatter whines through the phone speaker as the young woman gently lays the phone back down in its cradle.\n \nThom transfers his attention to a large painting on the inner wall above the entrance of the restaurant. It\u2019s a jungle scene, with primates peeking out of thick foliage through leaves and vines and branches and bushes. A baboon in the center of the painting stares directly at Thom. It has green eyes. Thom does not recall baboons having green eyes.\n \nThom begins to turn his attention back to the table but pauses halfway, instead staring at a cracked tile in the middle of the floor. He doesn\u2019t want to look at the table, but he has to know. He can\u2019t help but look at the wonton strips.\n \nAs he completes his turn back toward the table he squints nervously, blurring and obscuring the table\u2019s contents so all he sees is a hazy constellation of gray, brown, and white. Now he opens his eyes enough that he can see a full puddle of grease nearly covering the bottom of the basket. It is opaque, thick, congealing.\n \nThom has a headache. Thom feels he might throw up.\n \nBut more importantly, Thom needs napkins.\n \nThom kicks himself for not acting sooner. Thom always did this. Escaping. Hiding. Not facing reality. Not \u201ctaking care of his business.\u201d And now more victims. More bodies. More skeletons for Thom to tuck away in his proverbial closet.\n \nNow he can\u2019t take his eyes off the basket, no matter how painful the scene. Then the basket darkens. Darkness overtakes the entire table. Thom fears the darkness will swallow him too as it moves closer, and he resigns himself to his imminent destruction.\n \n\u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d It was the woman from the register. She was standing in front of the nearest fluorescent light, casting a shadow over the table.\n \n\u201cAh! Ah!\u201d Thom screams. His breaths become quick and heavy as he looks directly into her face.\n \n\u201cWha-what?! Huh?!\u201d she replies, looking even more terrified than Thom. However, her terror quickly turns from a reactionary emotional impulse to a quite legitimate concern regarding what the fuck might be wrong with this guy.\n \nShe nervously tries to smile, but her struggle in that regard only further gives away her crippling level of discomfort.\n \n\u201cShould I come back?\u201d she asks.\n \n\u201cUh\u2026. Um. No. No. I mean, yes. Well, no. But yes. Well, something else. I have a question,\u201d Thom says.\n \nThe woman is probably in her early 20s, and she appears to be of East Asian descent. She\u2019s wearing a white blouse, and Thom sizes up her ensemble. She has her long sleeves rolled up to just above her elbows, and the blouse is fully buttoned save for the one at the very top, right at the collar. She\u2019s wearing a thin, gold necklace. He notices that the stitching on the-\n \n\u201cShit,\u201d Thom thinks to himself, inaudibly. \u201cHow much time has passed since I told her I had a question? Did she respond at all? It doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t end on \u2018I have a question.\u2019 God damn it Thom, say something. Fucking say something Thom. Thom! Thom! Say something! She\u2019s waiting! THOM! SAY SOMETHING THOM! SAY SOMETHING!\u201d\n \nThe woman\u2019s mouth stays slightly open as she stands awkwardly in front of him, as though she\u2019s not sure if she should say something. He just keeps staring at her neck.\n \nHe looks down, takes a deep breath, and clasps his hands together. Then he raises those clasped hands and begins to hit his forehead hard, the protruding knuckle of his right thumb battering a nerve just above the bridge of his nose.\n \nThe waitress takes a few steps back. While the battering continues, Thom begins to growl. He rocks in his chair. He looks up toward the entrance and sees the baboon is still watching him. And it still has those green fucking eyes.\n \n\u201cEEEEErrrrrrrrooooooEEEEEEErrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooo.\u201d Thom\u2019s growl mixes with a squeal and the sound begins to approach something resembling functional language.\n \n\u201cRrrawreeeeer!\u201d\n \nNot close enough. Thom regroups and attempts to compose himself, with the goal of verbalizing at least one intelligible phrase. He forces his hands into his lap, sits up enough to create clear airflow through relevant passages, and then Thom manages to squeeze entire sentences out, albeit very quickly and with much shakiness:\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but where are the napkins? Can you please get me some napkins? I can\u2019t find any napkins. I know. I know. It should be OK. They\u2019re just wonton strips. Right? But, but look. See? Do you see? And there are no napkins. Can you please help me? Please?\u201d\n \n\u201cUh\u2026 Sure\u2026. Yes. OK. Yeah,\u201d she replies, backing away slowly before walking briskly toward the back.\n \nOnly now does Thom notice he has several tables of fellow patrons, arranged and seated just beyond some half-closed curtains, all looking at him. He does not understand how he didn\u2019t see them before.\n \nThom looks up at a ceiling fan, then down at the fingers of his right hand. With his middle finger he rubs a hangnail on the outer-right edge of his pointer finger. Then he picks at it with his pinkie. He rubs his lower lip against the hangnail and glances over just enough to see the baboon still staring at him.\n \nThe waitress pokes her head out from the doorway to the kitchen and gestures in Thom\u2019s direction, while an older man next to her looks toward him and nods his head.\n \nUh oh. Oops. Thom needs to get the fuck out of here. He decides to cut his losses and sacrifice the wontons. His body shakes and trembles. He can\u2019t stand being there for one second longer.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I can\u2026 Never mind. It\u2019s OK. But. I mean. Um. I have a thing. To do. I mean, sorry. No. I mean\u2026 Never mind. OK! Bye! Thank you!\u201d\n \nHaving nailed all relevant etiquette guidelines, Thom stands up, relying heavily on the back of the chair for support. His right foot is asleep. He rocks back and forth to put weight on it and hopefully recirculate some blood in there. But he doesn\u2019t have time for that. It feels like thousands of eyes watching him now, and when he peers into the periphery there\u2019s something dark and menacing about those faces beyond the curtain. All he can see near the entrance now are those two eyes. It looks like that baboon might jump out of the painting at any moment. But everything is getting dark now. The glow of the neon OPEN sign dims. Bulbs flicker.\n \nThom lumbers toward the door as quickly as possible, his right foot sending vibrations through his leg and up his spine. He hits the left side of the double-door hard with his shoulder, but it gives slowly, and only when Thom puts all his body weight into the push does it open all the way.\n \nHe stumbles out onto the sidewalk and turns left toward a small set of steps leading behind the building. As he starts to jog the tingles, crackles, aches, and other sensations happening in his legs seem to evaporate, and he notices it\u2019s warm outside. All Thom can hear is the beating of his heart and the \n of his shoes hitting the pavement.\n \nHe makes it behind the building and finds a tree near a chain-link fence where he inspects the ground nearby for ants. He sits down, crosses his legs, and curls his torso inward.\n \nThom lifts his hands just enough to press them against his closed eyelids. Inside he sees tiny swirling shapes laid over what resembles TV screen static.\n \nOccasionally Thom sees demons when he presses on his eyes, but he can make those go away when he tries harder. You see, Thom has all this negative self-talk inside him, and when he\u2019s inside here things have a way of manifesting visually. So yeah. It makes perfectly reasonable sense why Thom would have so many \u201cdemons.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cStay positive. Stay positive,\u201d Thom tells himself. \u201cYou\u2019re OK. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s OK. Everything\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t even worry. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n \nThe words lose their meaning. They\u2019re just noises now. Closer to radio interference than spoken English. The background brightens slightly and shimmers with a mustard yellow hue. Then a pulsating green begins to seep into the foreground, and Thom readies himself.\n \nThe demons are usually green for some reason, and sometimes they never evolve beyond this amorphous glow phase. If they do form a face it\u2019s usually emotionless and undefined, as if it were actually a mask for something else. The most frustrating thing about them is that when they arrive they take up so much space.\n \nThough he isn\u2019t in the restaurant anymore he still feels eyes on him. And then, with no ado whatsoever, here it is. The baboon. It still inhabits a jungle, but Thom zooms in until there\u2019s nothing left but the eyes. They begin to glow, their light crowding out everything else.\n \nThen Thom breaks through. It\u2019s all darkness again, but now Thom feels he has a certain degree of control, as though he now holds a loose grip on some lucid dream.\n \nHe sees no more eyes. No more green. No more yellow. Just gray. There are trees now. Flowers. He sees a silhouette cross against the backdrop and before it can turn into anything malevolent he crafts it into a little girl skipping. She starts to sing, almost like a taunt, and she skips among the flowers as she sings.\n \n\u201cThe children play in the land with no sun! The children play in the land with no sun!\u201d\n \nShe laughs, and Thom does not like her laughter.\n \nThe scene reminds Thom of a carving hanging on the wall in his parents\u2019 bathroom when he was a kid. He never saw the circle in it as a sun, because all the wood was burned. The carving created these off-white lines, exposing the fresh wood below.\n \nThom is in control again. He forms clouds over the scene and then he swirls them about, as though using them to erase a chalkboard. He makes the clouds turn red. They dance. Then Thom pans down until the clouds are gone and all he can see is a tree.\n \nThe tree appears to have a man sitting under it. The man under the tree leans forward with his fingers pressed against his eyes. The man looks sort of like Thom. Thom bends the lines just so, and he makes the man look almost exactly like himself. The level of detail excites Thom, but it disappoints him that he can\u2019t seem to control the color anymore. Especially because that color is green.\n \nThom decides he should relieve the pressure from his eyes because he\u2019s been pushing on them for so long. The only problem is that Thom can\u2019t really feel his eyes anymore. The man under the tree is still there, and the man\u2019s image grows in such a way that Thom almost feels like he\u2019s swooping towards the man. No, he \n swooping, and his momentum is so great that Thom doesn\u2019t think he can turn back.\n \nThom still can\u2019t feel his eyes. He can\u2019t even see that image of himself anymore. It\u2019s almost as if Thom had switched perspectives. Because now he can see grass underneath him. There\u2019s a tree behind him again. But he still can\u2019t feel his eyes.\n \nAnd everything is still green. He sees hundreds of ants swarming around the tree. No, there must be thousands. They begin to crawl onto his pants. He tries to scream, but there\u2019s no sound. There\u2019s never sound in here. It\u2019s only the colors.\n \n\u201cWhy is everything green?\u201d Thom asks himself. \u201cIt had been gray before. Outside. Before I pressed on my eyes. Right? But now it\u2019s all green. And now I can\u2019t take any of it back.\u201d\n \nThom no longer knows exactly where he is.\n \nThe ants grow in number until they cover Thom\u2019s pants and then they form a hill obscuring the lower half of his body. They crawl up his torso and arms like moss covering a tree. Then they stop, right as they reach the bottom of his nose. Only the top half of Thom\u2019s head remains. He looks down and sees the girl skipping. She grins up at him, drooling. As she wipes the slobber from her chin with her forearm, she seems to be looking beyond him into the distance.\n \nThen the ants fall away. Then the grass, the ground, the tree. With no more anchors or supports, Thom begins to float. There\u2019s nothing left to hold him all together. All the little pieces around him meld with all his little pieces, and he fears we will all blow away soon too. Thom imagines himself as one of those wonton strips, breaking down into a million crumbs. And as he thinks it, he tastes them. Burnt and sandy.\n \nThom is gone. He thinks he\u2019s gone. But then how can he feel the grit? How can he sense a dryness in his throat? He can still feel the crumbs wriggling inside him, tickling his lips and mouth, and then he feels them burrow down inside his chest and stomach.\n \nThom can\u2019t breathe. There are too many ants. Too many crumbs. He crumbles and swirls. He\u2019s only colors now.\n \nThom needs to concentrate. He needs to put us back together again. He broke us down into such small pieces. It\u2019s too hard to put it all back now. We\u2019re too cold. It\u2019s too cold to thaw us out.\n \nBut Thom can\u2019t feel the cold anymore. In fact, Thom feels hot. Really hot. And he can\u2019t undress. Because he doesn\u2019t have clothes. He doesn\u2019t even have a body. He doesn\u2019t have eyes.\n \nBut Thom still sees the greens. Only the greens. And as all the aberrations blend together, only one uniform shade remains.\n "}
{"title": "Under The Bed", "story": "\tWhen Thomas was four years old he woke to a strange noise coming from his closet. It was a sound like a slow moving creature walking through his toybox. Down the hall the light from his mother\u2019s bedroom was on. Thomas got out of bed and went to his mother\u2019s room where she was curling her hair in the bathroom.\u00a0\n\t\u201cMom, there is something in my toybox,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked..\u00a0\n\t\u201cI hear something. It's moving around, and it's scaring me.\u201d\n\t\u201cOh it's fine, it's just your step father,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\tIt didn't make sense why his step father would be in his closet in the toybox, but this answer satisfied him and he went back to his room. In the dark he could see his reflection in the mirror of his sliding closet doors. He watched himself while listening to his stepfather walking around in his toybox.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tIt was on a different occasion when he heard a sound like someone pressing their head against the wall and walking down the hall. The hairy scratchy noise of the hair follicles against sheetrock and scalp sliding toward the opening of his bedroom where it finally stopped. He was terrified and could barely get himself back to sleep that night. When he woke and his stepfather was making him breakfast he told him about the strange noise and how it had scared him.\u00a0\n\t\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it was just Lokey,\u201d his stepfather said, that was the cat. And just at that moment Lokey jumped up onto the kitchen table, startling him, his black slender body brushing up against Thomas\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\tWhen Thomas was six years old he began to hear tapping on his bed at night. It would wake him up and he would lay there listening to the ghostly rhythm on the bedframe. These noises scared him, especially when\u00a0 the tapping was accompanied by whispering. The words were always just out of reach, he could only make out the sound of someone saying something. \n     The explanations from his parents about these kinds of happenings were always the same.\n\t\u201cThomas, it's probably just the cat,\u201d or \u201cThomas, I think it was your mom, I know she got up in the middle of the night.\u201d\u00a0\n\tOne night when Thomas came back from the bathroom in the middle of the night he discovered a monster under his bed. He didn't notice it at first, it was only when he had jumped in bed and looked into the mirrors of the closet doors that he saw it in the reflection.\u00a0\n\tHis first thought was that maybe his stepfather snuck into his room while he was in the bathroom, it was October after all, and Halloween was right around the corner, maybe he was trying to frighten him. But the face of what was down there didn\u2019t look like his stepfather, or his mother for that matter. The face was a dull bluish white with a slender body, and if there were any eyes they were tucked away in dark sockets unseen. Thomas lay there watching the face until he fell asleep.\u00a0\n\tEach night after that, he would see the monster under the bed. He made sure that he didn't drink any liquids too late so he wouldn\u2019t have to go to the restroom in the middle of the night. His mother would check under his bed before he got in to make sure nothing was there. He was worried he might mistake something like a crumpled up sweatshirt or one of his toys for a monster. But each night he woke in terror as staring back at him in the mirror was that ghostly white face.\u00a0\n\tAfter months of this Thomas began to feel comfortable with seeing the monster under his bed. One night, feeling a little brave Thomas slid the covers off his leg and moved his foot to the edge of the bed. The cold air made the flesh on his ankle rise with goose pimples. Slowly Thomas moved his foot further off the edge, keeping his eyes on the empty sockets of the monster. Inch by inch until finally the monster shifted his gaze toward the approaching foot. And that\u2019s when a slender arm appeared that had been tucked away against the monster\u2019s side. It began to reach up toward his dangling toes. Thomas pulled his leg back and the slender hand slowly returned to where it came.\u00a0\n\tThomas told his parents about the monster trying to get his foot.\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt's probably just your imagination, honey,\u201d is all his mom could think to say.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYeah, remember,\u201d his stepfather said to him at the breakfast table, \u201cthere is no such thing as monsters.\u201d\n\tEach night when Thomas would wake to see the monster staring at him from under the bed he would feel a compulsion to slide his foot toward the edge. And the monster's dead face would slowly turn as his foot came into view, and that slender hand would reach toward his foot. And just before it got what it wanted Thomas would quickly move it away. And the pale hand would return to its place.\u00a0\n\t\tThe weekend before Halloween his parents threw a costume party at their house. The evening was full of witches and ghouls and monsters of different variety, there was punch and hors d'oeuvres, and most importantly, other kids to play with.\u00a0\n\tThomas\u2019s mom had taken him to the Halloween store to get a costume a few days before and despite all of her suggestions, Thomas insisted that he only wanted to paint his face the same color as the monster under his bed.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat about this?\u201d his mother asked, holding up a creepy mask, \u201cor what about a vampire? You could paint your face the color you want and have fangs!\u201d\n\t\u201cNo. I just want to be the monster under my bed.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, okay, but don\u2019t you want to dress up?\n\t\u201cYes. but all I need is white makeup and black eyes.\u201d\n\t\u201cOkay, but you can\u2019t be naked, I know you said the monster under your bed looked naked, you can\u2019t do that, okay?\u201d\u00a0\n\tAt the party when the other children asked what he was supposed to be, Thomas told them that he was the monster \u201cunder my bed.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cA real monster?\u201d a little girl asked him.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYeah. A real one. I see it every night and it wants to eat my leg.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThat's creepy.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cDo you want to see it?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cNo,\u201d the little girl said, and walked away.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI do,\u201d said a little vampire.\u00a0\n\tIn his bedroom the bravest of kids came with Thomas to his room. He instructed them to get onto his bed and he would slide underneath. At first Thomas didn\u2019t think much of it until the lights were off, his eyes slowly adjusting to the sudden darkness.\u00a0\n\tAs the bedroom came into view he could see the three brave souls on his bed. A vampire, a zombie, and a werewolf. And then there was Thomas, his white face illuminated, reflecting back his dead looking complexion with what light was coming from his window. He wasn\u2019t paying much attention to his fidgeting friends, he became absorbed in watching himself, playing the part of the monster that visited him each night.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI can see you,\u201d said the zombie on the bed.\n\t\u201cYeah, you don\u2019t look that scary,\u201d said the werewolf.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re being weird,\u201d said the vampire.\u00a0\n\tBut Thomas didn\u2019t say anything. He was quiet, still and hoped that his eyes weren't able to be seen.\u00a0\n\tThe werewolf began crying, and the other two started to whimper and sob, scared of the monster under the bed. The vampire suddenly leaps off the bed and runs for the door. He grabs the doorknob and yanks it open, casting light and sound from the living room. The Monster Mash is playing and the other two children leap from the bed and go running out. Thomas watches them go.\n\tThe shadows of the dancers move about the walls like cave dwellers, and the music pumps into the room. With the light coming in Thomas can see himself more clearly now, his eyes are glistening balls surrounded by black. As he stares into his own eyes he begins to feel a presence behind him. The hair on his neck feels staticky, and ever so slightly his bedroom door begins to close by itself. He feels a strong urge to scramble out from under his bed but he doesn't move, too afraid by the presence behind him. And as the light from the living room begins to fade away he looks into the mirror and behind him is the face of the monster, the pale face with absent eyes. The darkness of the room collapses around him and in the dark he feels a body press against his and the hand on that slender arm comes around him and pulls him under.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}

He leaned back against the chimney and studied the map Father had given him during training. \n \nJack\u2019s first lost tooth was due at Pearl\u2019s Refinery by sunrise, or the magic power needed to keep the Land of Fairytales alive would disappear.\n \nThis was Easton\u2019s first assignment as a tooth fairy, the same position Avery, his father, held for decades. His father was the best tooth fairy in centuries, highly respected by the Land of Fairytales\u2019 citizens.\n \nClosing his eyes, Easton tried to recall his mistake. He\u2019d flown north for half an hour then shifted east. He was in the correct town, but this street map was confusing. \n When he opened his eyes, Peter stood beside him.\n \n\u201cPeter, how\u2019d you get here?\u201d Easton asked.\n \n\u201cHow else? I hopped,\u201d Peter answered.\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re not on duty until Easter,\u201d Easton said.\n \n\u201cI have responsibilities besides Easter,\u201d Peter replied.\n \n\u201cLike what?\u201d Easton asked.\n \n\u201cYou have so much to learn.\u201d Peter shook his head.\n \n\u201cLike how to read this map to find Jack\u2019s house,\u201d Easton said.\n \n\u201cI go every Easter. Take Main Street to First Avenue, then left on Banks Boulevard. Jack\u2019s house is third on the right,\u201d Peter said.\n \n\u201cThanks.\u201d Easton flew towards Main Street.\n \nAt the corner of Main and First Street, he noticed bright lights in the distance. He recalled his father describing Krampus, Dracula, and the Big Bad Wolf, but this didn\u2019t fit those descriptions. Gathering his courage, Easton flew towards the lights. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s Easton,\u201d Santa said.\n \n\u201cIs that Santa?\u201d Easton asked.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the reindeer and me,\u201d Santa replied.\n \n\u201cChristmas is months away,\u201d Easton said.\n \n\u201cWe have responsibilities besides Christmas,\u201d Santa explained.\n \n\u201cLike what?\u201d Easton asked.\n \nSanta chuckled. \u201cYou have so much to learn.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you headed to the North Pole?\u201d Easton asked.\n \n\u201cThe sleigh is broken, and without the maintenance elves, our situation isn\u2019t good,\u201d Santa said.\n \nEaston studied the sleigh. \u201cIf we tighten this bracket, I\u2019m certain the sleigh will work.\u201d\n \nReaching onto the sleigh, Santa revealed a red tool bag. \u201cI never go out unprepared.\u201d\n \nEaston rummaged through the bag, located the perfect wrench, and in no time, he\u2019d fixed Santa\u2019s sleigh.\n \nThe reindeer exclaimed, \u201cThanks, Easton.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Easton glanced at his watch. \u201cBut now I\u2019ve forgotten the way to Jack\u2019s house.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe go there every Christmas,\u201d Santa said. \u201cFollow First Avenue. You\u2019ll see Banks Boulevard. Jack\u2019s house is third on the right.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe magic power in Jack\u2019s tooth disappears at sunrise.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d Santa hopped on the sleigh.\nRiding with Santa was an honor. Only the most prestigious citizens ever rode in the magical sleigh. \n \n\u201cAny closer, and we\u2019ll confuse the children. Fly straight down. You\u2019ll land at Jack\u2019s house.\u201d\n \nEaston waved and flew straight down, landing in Jack\u2019s backyard.\n \nEaston tiptoed down the hallway. While Jack slept, he slipped his hand under the pillow, found the special tooth, and replaced it with shiny coins before heading out.\n \nA storm brewed towards the south, moving towards the Land of Fairytales. Easton hoped to beat the storm home.\n \nEaston\u2019s wings were heavy as the wind blew against his back. When Easton checked his pocket, the tooth fell out and drifted down. \nThe land below was covered with tall oaks and pines. Easton feared he\u2019d lost Jack\u2019s tooth. He flew down in search of the tooth, but a white flash zipped past and dropped the tooth in his pocket before he reached the land.\n \n\u201cStork, is that you?\u201d Easton asked.\n \n\u201cYes. Now, hurry home,\u201d Stork replied.\n \n\u201cI thought you only delivered babies,\u201d Easton said.\n \n\u201cYou have so much to learn.\u201d Stork flew away and disappeared. \nMustering all his strength, Easton tried to fly home, but he couldn\u2019t go anywhere.\n \nEaston\u2019s eyes welled with tears. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d A woman dressed in flowers appeared beside him. \n \n\u201cMother Nature? Is that you?\u201d Easton asked.\n \n\u201cI calmed the storm, so you\u2019d get home by sunrise,\u201d Mother Nature answered.\n \n\u201cYou only handle the weather for humans,\u201d Easton said.\n \n\u201cYou have so much to learn.\u201d Mother Nature disappeared in the sky. \nEaston sped home faster than ever. \n \nWhen he entered Pearl\u2019s Refinery, he thought he\u2019d arrived in time, but Pearl greeted him frowning.\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Pearl scolded.\n \nWhen Easton removed the tooth from his pocket, the tooth once bright with power now dimly flickered. \u201cSurely, there\u2019s still power.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe decision belongs to the Land of Fairytales\u2019 board of commissioners waiting next door,\u201d Pearl said.\n \nHe\u2019d heard rumors of the board of commissioners, the elders in the Land of Fairytales, who made the important decisions.\nWith his head down, Easton opened the door. He missed sunrise by nearly a minute. He disappointed everyone, especially Father. Easton placed the dimly lit tooth on the board of commissioners\u2019 table.\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s not ready.\u201d Father Time\u2019s deep voice bellowed out.\nMother Goose peered over her glasses. \u201cHe needs more time to study the books.\u201d\n \n\u201cAvery should provide the boy more training.\u201d Peter Pan said.\n \nEaston\u2019s face blushed in embarrassment. A dozen of the Land of Fairytales\u2019 elders discussed his failure.\n \n\u201cThe boy\u2019s simply not ready.\u201d Gingerbread Man shook his finger.\nSanta cleared his throat. \u201cEaston isn\u2019t a boy. He understands his responsibilities. Though he was late for his special task, when Easton found us stranded, he took the time to repair the sleigh and rescued the reindeer and me. Easton understands the Land of Fairytales\u2019 most important assignment\u2015helping one another.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo more chattering.\u201d Cupid stood, raising an arm. \u201cLet\u2019s vote.\u201d\n \nEaston squeezed his eyes shut while the elders voted. \n \n\u201cAll who vote nay, raise your hand.\u201d Cupid paused. \u201cNow, all who vote yay, raise your hand.\u201d\n \nWhen Easton opened his eyes, the once dimly lit tooth on the table now glowed with magic power.\n \nEaston stood proudly as Santa made the announcement. The Land of Fairytales\u2019 board of commissioners named Easton the official tooth fairy for the world. \n "}
{"title": "Chirp, Chee, Chirp", "story": "\tTimothy\u2019s mother said goodnight, turned out the light, and closed the door. He lay awake in his bed in the dark. The sound of the trees blowing in the wind outside kept him awake just long enough to hear his mother flush the toilet before she retired. \u00a0\n\tIt had been a year since his father passed away. Timothy had what some would describe as a comfortable lower middle class life, but at the age of five none of that was his concern. He cared more for Legos and stuffed animals than he did anything else but that evening he was thinking about how the kids at school had been particularly rough on him since he was the only one in his class whose father had not come to career day. His mother could have made an appearance but her job was nothing more than a fast food manager. Even at his age he knew it wasn't glorious. She would come home some days worn out, hunched over, and barely able to carry on a conversation as she made him dinner. But still none of that even mattered as he lay there in bed. \n\tThirty seconds after the toilet flushed he heard his mother's bedroom door close followed by her phone landing on the nightstand ever so softly. A neighborhood dog could be heard barking in the distance\u2014Suddenly there was a rustling. His eyes, which were only half closed, opened wide. He swore he\u2019d heard something under his bed.\u00a0He shook as goosebumps ran down his body. The shadows in his room danced around. Some of which were those of the leaves outside still on the trees. A late fall it was that year. Others he did not know at his age. One was the five and a half foot tall stuffed bear his father had won at the county fair. Another was\u2014And he heard the rustling again. \n\t\"Mom,\" he cried out to no avail. The house was silent. \"Mom,\" he cried again.\n\tThe sound of her bedroom door, her feet on the wood floor, and there she was. \n\t\"Yes, my dear?\" Timothy\u2019s mother answered. \n\t\"There's something under my bed,\" he said.\n\t\"Hun, we go through this every night. There is never anything under your bed.\" \n\t\"But I heard something.\" \n\t\"I'm sure it was the trees outside.\" \n\t\"Just look,\" he pleaded. \n\tShe looked to appease Timothy. Halfway under the bed she spotted two eyes looking at her. She jumped hitting her head and on the bed frame. Before her were two eyes that were surrounded by a green ball of fluff about the size of a small puppy.\u00a0It stood there staring at her with the two beady little eyes and its weird floppy ears and what appeared to be a tongue hanging out between the sharpest teeth she'd ever seen.\n\t\u00a0It was a baby monster. \n\tNever before had she missed her late husband that much. He would have known what to do. He'd dealt with things like this during his years in The Space Federation. He would have immediately known. True intelligent extraterrestrial life had not yet been contacted but that does not mean they hadn't landed several men on several different planets outside the solar system.\n\t\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d she asked cautiously. \n\tThe creature gave no reply. \n\tTimothy\u2019s mother coaxed the cute little monster out from under the bed and picked it up.\u00a0Holding it in her palms, she tried to show timothy, but he was cowering under the covers. The monster shivered as if it was cold.\u00a0Timothy\u2019s mother took a step close to the lump under the covers and said, \u201cTimothy the little fella is scared too.\u00a0You should look at it, it\u2019s adorable.\u201d\u00a0\n\tTimothy peeked out from under his blankets.\u00a0Suddenly the little monster made the cutest sound they had ever heard, chirp, chee, chirp, while hopping up and down in Timothy\u2019s mother\u2019s hand. \u00a0\n\tTimothy\u2019s interest seemed to pique. He got out of bed to get a better look.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cCan we keep it mom?\u201d he asked. \n\t\u201cDo you want to stay with us little guy?\u201d Timothy\u2019s mother asked the little monster.\n\t\u201cChirp, chee,\u201d it said as it jumped into Timothy\u2019s red hair. \n\tTimothy\u2019s squeal was somewhere between delight and shock, causing the little guy jump again and chirp louder than before. Timothy began to laugh.\u00a0Timothy\u2019s mother tried to remove it from Timothy\u2019s hair but the little monster must have thought it he\u2019d found a nest as it tried to settle in.\u00a0\n\tTimothy\u2019s mother ran to the linen closet to get some towels while Timothy sat with the little monster on his head chirping.\u00a0\u00a0When she returned she asked if timothy knew where his clown wig was.\u00a0Timothy pointed to his closet. She opened the door and pulled out the wig then took the towels and made a little bed across the room using the wig.\u00a0She picked the monster up out of Timothy\u2019s hair and moved it to the makeshift nest in the corner and just to be safe she slept in Timothy\u2019s room until they got up the next morning. \n\tWhen they awoke the little monster was hopping around the room chirping. Chirp, chee, chirp. It seemed louder more desperate. Timothy thought it must be hungry. \n\t\u201cMom what can we feed it?\u201d\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know honey, all we have is some fruit in the fridge.\u201d\n\t\u201cCan we try that mom?\u201d\n\t\u201cOk but he\u2019s going to get bigger. And we don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll want to ear. Maybe we should find out where it came from. He might want to go home.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut I wanna keep it.\u201d\n\tPondering what Timothy had said she helped him fed the little guy raspberries and blackberries which quieted it for a moment before it began chirping again. This time it was the same happy sound they had heard last night. Timothy giggled with glee as his mother\u2019s heart sank. She had made her decision.\n\tTimothy and her mother got to the car with the monster. His mother buckled him in the back seat then placed the little guy on his lap. Checking the review mirror she could see how happy the two were together as she backed the car out of the driveway. She knew what was ahead. \n\tTimothy was crying because he didn\u2019t want to lose his new friend.\u00a0After some walking they heard a familiar sound.\u00a0Soon they spotted hundreds of other fluff balls by a wrecked ship. The chirping grew louder as they neared the clearing in the trees. The sound was beautiful.\u00a0Timothy\u2019s new friend began chirping. Timothy placed the monster on the ground. It seemed to recognize the other creatures, but wouldn\u2019t go over to them. Instead it turned and looked at Timothy. Timothy began crying. He didn\u2019t want his new friend to go. \n\tTimothy\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t bear to separate them.\u00a0If it ate berries and stayed this small, she thought, then it might be a good companion for her son. Maybe they could keep it after all.\u00a0\n\tShe knelt. \u201cWhat would you like to name him, Timothy?\u201d\n\t\u201cBut you\u2019re making him go away.\u201d\n\tShe wiped the tear from his cheek. \u201cYou can keep it. If it wants to stay with us.\u201d\n\t\u201cWe can keep him?\u201d He sniffled as his eyes smiled.\n\tTimothy\u2019s mother looked at the little guy in her son\u2019s arms. \u201cDo you want to live with us, little guy?\u201d\n\tIt began chirping once more. Chirp, chee, chirp.\n\tTimothy\u2019s face lit up. \u201cCan we name him Chirpy?\u201d\n\tHis mother continued looking at the little green monster, \u201cWould you like that little fella?\u201d\n\tChirp, chee, chirp."}
{"title": "To Make Believe", "story": "Warning: violence, gore and racism\n \nThrough the porthole Herman observed two dozen silvery-white flying fish skim the waves as the sun sunk into the horizon and the infinite sea turned a kaleidoscope of fantastic purples that glittered like gemstones.\u00a0Though painfully beautiful, he sighed regardless. He blinked back more tears, wondering what it would feel like to dive into the hypnotic, churling, waves.\u00a0He turned as the cabin\u2019s door opened. \n \n\tHis Aunt Danika came into the cabin.\u00a0She had a pigeon nestled in her hand. \u201cHello my darling.\u00a0Oh, how it saddens me to see you so despondent.\u201d She stroked the soft grey bird along it\u2019s pink and green iridescent neck and it cooed softly. \n \n\tHerman had heard many stories of her fantastic ability to communicate with nature\u2019s creatures. \n.\u2019 He was too upset to admit the communion between woman and bird appeared genuine. \n \n\tShe said, \u201cYour cousin is so happy to have you come live with us.\u201d\n \n\tHerman sniffed and scowled. He had adored his cousin who had told him stories of adventure and magic, always adding at the end they were true.\u00a0He had clapped and begged for another.\n \n\tThe last time he\u2019d seen Andre, he had again insisted his story was a true one. But Herman was then ten years old, Andre, thirteen, and Herman had scoffed. \u201cStop teasing me now cousin.\u00a0I know all these stories are made up\u2026I\u2019m too old for Santa Klaus.\u201d\n \n\tAndre had said, \u201cBut they \n real.\u00a0I do not lie.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cYou\u2019re only three years older than I. Stop treating me like a wee babe!\u201d\n \n\tAndre had attempted to calm Herman, insisting that he could trust him.\u00a0Herman, who had lost his mother during the birth of his little brother who had only lived three days, was angry and only wanted to hear truths.\u00a0He felt as though everyone had been lying to him.\u00a0His father \u2018self-medicated\u2019 himself and anyone could see he was dying. This angered and depressed Herman.\u00a0\n \n\tHerman\u2019s father had worked a forge all day long and provided well, but when coming into a silent home devoid of the love of his life and the babe she\u2019d tried to bring, he fell again and again into a whiskey jug.\u00a0Herman could almost believe the drunken man had fallen into his forge on purpose.\n \n\t\u201cWhy do you feel such dread coming to your new home? I thought you and Andre were close.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cAuntie\u2026he treats me like a child, like a wee babe hangin on his every word.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not believe the stories he tells you?\u201d\n\u201cWitches and magic and sea creatures larger than this ere ship?\u00a0I used to. I admit it.\u00a0But I\u2019ve grown up\u2026\u201d\n \n\tThe edges of Danika\u2019s lips curved up slightly.\u00a0When she came to look out the porthole next to him, her amber colored eyes turned purple, even reflecting the tiny bright sparkles that flew from the rippling waves. He shook his head, dark curls springing over his dark eyes.\u00a0\u201cYou mock me too then?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cNo child. Never. Have you ever considered that perhaps Andre believes the stories?\u201d\n \n\tPuzzled, Herman frowned.\u00a0\u201cNo. I uh\u2026Is he daft in th\u2019 \u2018ed then?\u201d\n \n\tDanika laughed.\u00a0\u201cNo child.\u00a0He earns stars in all his lessons. He wishes to become a great writer someday.\u201d\n \n\tHerman decided his cousin was indeed daft in the head.\u00a0His father used to say that all great writers had to be because their imaginations were too big to be contained in a skull.\u00a0Herman used to read him the Weekly Gazette and books by Shakespeare, Milton, and Perrault\u2026his favorite was Cervantes.\n \n\t\u201cTis sad when a person loses their imagination.\u00a0Even sadder to lose their faith.\u00a0Alas, it is part of growing up I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d \n \n\tHerman broke from his reverie and saw that the stars were twinkling into view.\n \n\t\u201cShall I bring us some supper Herman?\u201d\n\t\u201cCan we eat in the galley with the crew?\u201d\n\t\u201cWhy not.\u201d\n \n \n \nBefore going below deck to the galley, Danika and Herman decided to walk a circuit of the deck. The Caribbean night just past sunset was warm although the ship was now headed north, into the North Atlantic Sea. \u00a0A moon nearly full lit their way, and the bustle of life on the top deck was diminished to a man at the helm, a few crew members coiling ropes and stowing equipment, and a man in the crow\u2019s nest. No one paid them any mind, although the men they did pass glared and made odd thumps to their foreheads with fingers splayed.\n \n\tHerman said, \u201cThe men hate you because they believe a woman on board is bad luck. Do you fear them?\u201d\n \n\tDanika stepped daintily over a puddle on the deck then stopped to look out at the ship\u2019s wake. \u201cDo you think it rational to fear women?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s silly.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, it is.\u00a0And no, I do not fear them.\u00a0It is they who fear me.\u201d\n\u201cSo, they are grown men who believe in witches and magic and all that?\u201d\nDanika laughed, the sound as delightful as the warm breezy night that smelled of salt and fish scales. A star directly before them flashed brilliant green, then faded.\n \n\tThey continued on their way towards the galley.\u00a0As they crossed midship, a faint crack rang out and echoed over them into the air. A scream followed.\u00a0Danika gripped Herman\u2019s hand tighter as a second crack came from below\u2026and another high-pitched wail of anguish.\nDanika quickened their pace and pulled her nephew along.\n \n \n \nIn the galley the men were all drunk.\u00a0Herman was amused by them.\u00a0They sang funny songs he did not really understand and then laughed uproariously at the end.\u00a0Jugs were passed his way and he partook small sips, wary to not drink from the ones passed from men with mouth sores.\u00a0\n \n\tAs they made their way towards the cook pots, the men clearing away from Danika with black looks in their faces, a gravelly voice bellowed to his mates, \u201cAye! That young welp of a blackie had some lungs on im! Now ee\u2019s got im some stripes on im too!\u201d He roared with laughter and the others roared too. \u201cLike a brown zee-bra ee is!\u201d\n \n\tAnother man, in a heavy hooded black cloak, said, \u201cAye. Lost another to the stench. Ad to run through the two bunkin wi\u2019 im\u2019 justa make sure it don spread.\u201d Herman recognized him as the first mate.\n \n\tDanika accepted a kettle of fish stew, two stale flatbreads, and a couple rinds of cheese.\u00a0She said to Herman, \u201cCome.\u201d Her face was red, and her hands were shaking\u2026he didn\u2019t argue.\n \n\tUp on the deck, she told him, \u201cGo to the cabin, I\u2019ll be in shortly.\u201d\n \n\tHerman made his way to their cabin below deck two stair lengths and aft over the wake.\u00a0Danika had paid three times the merchant\u2019s cost to see her and her nephew had safe passage. \n \n\tHerman left the kettle and went back to the ladder his aunt had descended.\u00a0She\u2019d gone all the way to the bottom where it was damp and pungent with eyewatering putridness.\n \n\tHe listened for her voice\u2026and it came.\n \n\tHe followed the sound through near darkness and sloshing floor.\u00a0He was aware that the walls were alive with faces. Faces so dark, they were more like phantoms, only the whites of their eyes gave them away as they followed his progress through the squalor.\u00a0He ducked behind a barrel- his aunt was there, passing out bread and cheese she had pilfered.\u00a0Also, her own rations.\u00a0He now understood why she\u2019d grown so thin during the last two months at sea.\n \n\tHe watched as she held a young man\u2019s hand.\u00a0His dark skin so beautiful in the light of her lantern, he was reminded of tales Andre had told of the far east, of genies and camels. A woman with chestnut colored skin wept silently beside him, holding his other hand, and petting his head. Herman saw another girl who looked as if she might be the woman\u2019s sister sitting wide-eyed at her side\u2026she looked barely older than he was. Danika had wrapped an ivory-colored under-skirt around the man\u2019s torso, as he leaned forward, he saw blood seeping through the fabric like blooming red poppies.\n \n\tShe stood, wiped the wetness from her cheeks, and came towards where Herman was concealed. \u201cCome child.\u00a0Tomorrow is a big day.\u201d\n \n \n \nBack in their cabin, Danika gave the fish stew to Herman and the remaining bread.\u00a0She pulled an old biscuit out from another of her many pockets and gave it to the pigeon. She said, \u201cHis name is Cirrus by the way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe captain named him?\u201d\n\u201cNo child. He does not belong to the captain. He\u2019s just visiting us until dawn.\u201d\n \n\tHerman gently stroked the bird and smiled.\u00a0Sad that the smile felt odd on his young face. Danika nodded at his untouched meal and said, \u201cCome now. You\u2019ve got to eat to stay healthy.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWhat did you mean about tomorrow bein a big day?\u201d\n\t\u201cOh yes.\u00a0Tomorrow we will be putting our feet on dry land.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut we\u2019re not due to land in Bermuda for another week at least\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201c\u2026A little detour is all. I\u2019m afraid this ship will not be safe for us after this night is through. Now, that\u2019s all I can say for now.\u00a0I\u2019ll not have ye worrying and fretful all night. Eat up and get to bed\u2026\u201d\n \n\t\u201cI\u2019ll eat only if you take my bread.\u201d\n \n\tDanika studied her nephew\u2019s earnest face and said, \u201cAll right. Oh. And Herman?\u201d\n\t\u201cYes?\u201d\n\t\u201cDo not wear your bed clothes this evening, please lie down as you are, boots an\u2019 all.\u201d\n \n \n \n \nFour hours later Herman was awakened by a loud noise.\n \n\tIt came again- \u2018\n\u2019 A loud thump, the sound like a giant\u2019s meaty fist pounding on a thick wooden door. \u2018\n \n\tShouts arose above the cabin, men\u2019s voices, and the thump of heavy footfalls up the stairs to the top decks. Herman\u2019s breath quickened along with his pulse.\u00a0He turned the wick knob to brighten the cabin. Danika rushed into the room and tossed a heavy black hooded cloak onto the bed. \u201cPut that on and grab your bag.\u201d She pointed to his small duffle.\u00a0Come on, Hurry now!\u201d\n \n\tHe did as she said and in seconds, they were racing up the stairs.\u00a0A tremendous thump nearly tossed them back down as the ship jerked upwards and sideways at the same time. Sea water splashed over the deck at their feet as they emerged from the hole in time to see the lookout tossed from the crow\u2019s nest and two others tossed overboard. The lookout\u2019s head burst like a ripe melon as it hit the deck.\n \n\tThe ship keeled the other way and more chilling water sprayed over their heads.\u00a0Men were running in every direction: some ran past them and down to the bilge room.\u00a0Some climbed the rope ladders in an effort to figure out what was happening.\n \n\tThe captain stood at the wheel with the helmsman and first mate. There was a crowd of crew members looking wildly about and bracing themselves as the ship was heaved upwards again. \n \n\t\n \n\tDanika and Herman went to the side of the ship and looked out over the sea.\u00a0The waves were choppy but not storm frenzied.\u00a0On the eastern horizon a thin line of yellowy pink hovered, it was a resplendent dawn.\n \n\tBehind them, a man shouted, \u201cThey\u2019re gone! The darkies! Vanished!\u201d\n \n\tHerman looked up at his aunt. She was smiling, the faint sunlight brightening her luminescent eyes like those of a cat. She looked like one who had just swallowed a canary.\n \n\tThe man pointed at Danika and snarled, \u201cHer! She\u2019s done this! Cur-sed bloody witch!\u201d He fell as the ship lurched again.\n \n\tThe ship slugged nearly sideways; it was obvious she was taking on water. A man stumbled out of the hold as another quake rocked the ship. He shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s too much water! The damage too great! We\u2019re goin dun!\u201d\n \n\tAnother crew member said, \u201cThe lifeboots!\u201d\n \n\tFrom above them, a man who had climbed into the crow\u2019s-nest pointed to the northwest. \u201cThe boats! The bloody boats!\u201d\nThe captain took the spyglass from the first mate and turned in that direction.\n \n\t\u2018\n\u2019 The ship surged upwards. \n \n\tDanika grabbed Herman\u2019s hand and said, \u201cCome on!\u201d She turned to the northeast and pulled Herman with her. The snarling man had gotten to his unsteady feet and was lurching towards them along with two others. All the crew but the helmsman were looking at them now with daggers in their eyes.\n \n\tThe snarling man pulled a gleaming, curved blade from his boot. A medley of faint sunlight glinted from many hands as the mob backed the man who was now just twenty feet behind them. \n \n\tThey made it to the railing facing the northeast. The snarling man stopped at the railing a gaped out at the sea. He was nearly toppled by the men coming up behind him who also stopped in their tracks to stare.\n \n\tThe four lifeboats were on the horizon.\u00a0Each held six to eight dark figures.\n \n\tThe captain made his way to Danika and Herman. \u201cWhat have you done!\u201d He roared. His sword drawn.\n \n\tThe crowd bawled all at once:\n\u201c---She\u2019s a witch! I tole youse all along!\u201d\n\u201c---Aye, saved iffen she die---\u201d\n\u201c---witch!---\u201d\n\u201c---runner through Mack!---\u201d\n \n\tMack lunged towards Danika.\u00a0She ducked and covered Herman with her body.\n \n\tA long thick shape rose from the sea side of the railing, like the trunk of a slick barked tree\u2026it rose over them swiftly then curled, revealing large pale suction cups, some as big as a man\u2019s head. Before Mack could turn around, the thick dark greenish tentacle slammed down through the railing and deck, taking the man down with it.\n \n\tA second and a third raised up\u2026 and down, bashing the deck and splintering the wood.\u00a0The ship rocked towards the side where the creature lurked, and eight men tumbled through the space where the railing had been.\n \n\tThe first mate lunged at Danika and pulled her to him, swinging her around to face the captain.\n \n\tHerman snatched up a short sword that had clattered to the deck and got caught up against the rail. He slashed at the first mate\u2019s knee backs. The first mate howled like a hyena in heat and dropped the woman.\u00a0\n \n\tThe captain raised his sword in a two-fisted grip and brought it down as Danika pulled the first mate down and rolled towards the captain\u2019s feet. His sword plunged into his first mate\u2019s head. The captain savagely roared.\u00a0As he worked to free his blade, an immense shadow rose behind him.\u00a0\n \n\tThe tentacle annihilated all three masts and the captain. Fat ropes twisted and flailed like writhing snakes in the air, beams crashed to the deck, the ship appeared to be breaking in two.\n \n\tThe few remaining men dove overboard. As their bodies entered the sea it frothed in a roiling boil until only a hand, a hat, and a boot inhabited with a knob of white bone, remained floating on the surging waves.\n \n\tHerman stared in wonder as a dark shape swam under the boat slowly. It seemed to be as large as the ship, its long tentacles waving behind its pointed squid shaped body.\u00a0It turned over just under the surface and he saw an enormous pale silver eye nearly the size of his torso\u2026it closed for a second as if winking.\u00a0\u2018\n.\u2019 \n \n\tAt fifty feet away, it flicked its trailing arms, causing it to propel out of sight like a shooting star.\n \n\tAs he followed the path it had taken, he saw one of the lifeboats re-appear on the horizon. \u201cLook!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes darling. I told you we would be fine.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026where are we?\u201d\n\u201cWell, over that way\u2026\u201d she pointed once again northeast \u201c\u2026is an uncharted island. That is where the dark-skinned men and women went, slaves no longer. We will camp with them for a few days.\u201d\n \n\tThe lifeboat reached the dying ship and Herman tossed one of the rope ladders from the broken center mast down.\n \n \n \nDanika nursed the handsome young man who had been whipped back to health and showed the new women of the island which plants were good for healing as well as eating and cultivating and weaving. The man\u2019s sister-in-law turned out to be with child even though she was just twelve years old. Danika vowed to return in eight months to help with what would surely be a difficult childbirth. \n \n\tShe cared for the ones recovering from dysentery and the ones showing signs of scurvy. One young man of about sixteen, had broken his arm on the ship when he\u2019d been beaten with a rifle; Danika was forced to re-break it so it would function again properly when healed.\n \n\tHerman helped when he could. He was particularly fond of foraging as a way of exploring the forests and freshwater ponds alongside some of the younger dark-skinned people.\u00a0They communicated through hand gestures and traded words for things neither had ever seen before.\u00a0He smiled and laughed a lot.\n \n\tJust before sunset on their sixth day, a ship appeared on the horizon.\u00a0Herman was alarmed at first. \u2018\n But then remembered they were all dead.\n \n\t\u201cThat will be your cousin Andre.\u201d\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s \n ship? And how\u2019d he know to come?\u201d\n\t\u201cOh child. Andre is fifteen now\u2026a little bird told him to come.\u201d\n \n\tAs the ship neared, Herman saw it was a frigate, much smaller than the ship that they\u2019d been on the week before.\u00a0It was much faster and able to pull in quite close to the shore.\u00a0Regardless, a tall fair haired figure dove into the turquoise cove and swam for the shore.\n \n\tHerman splashed through knee deep water to reach Andre whom he hugged like a bear. He cried, \u201cOh cousin! Have I got a story for you!\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Green tea", "story": "It is 6:00 am, no one is at work for another hour, except for me and a few others who were sent here to serve. I go to the room where morning meetings occur and I start my cleaning immediately, I sterilize the surfaces, vacuum, put new flowers, I even start on the morning coffee. Here at firm, everyone has their own preferences and it is quite complicated: black coffee, coffee with sugar and milk, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, the list goes on. However, there is one cup of green tea I serve every morning and it is for her, Meredith, tall, blue-eyed girl who always wears clothes which make other people look at her twice. I don't look twice, I look a million times. Every time we are not in interaction I pretend I work, but I secretly look at her. She makes me experience weird things I can't quite describe and don't get with anyone else.\nIt is 6:45 am now and people are starting to come. I open the door and greet every one of them getting nothing in return, usual drill I would say. They put their coats on me with nervous looking faces indicating they are not happy to be here. And then, she comes. She is the only one who greets me and, sometimes, she even asks how I am. Her interaction with me is usually followed by the laughter of others, like she will ever get an answer right? I am here just to clean, serve, be quiet, anything outside work orders and I will end up in the basement. The basement is the scariest place for us all, if you end up there, you shouldn't expect to come back. I close the door and put drinks on my serving tray. I actually do enjoy serving coffee, it is one of those things that keeps me in shape, to fulfill orders is my duty, my inner program, just like scanning every square meter of surface for dust or keeping windows clean. I am for sure not like the others, the ones who control all the fancy technologies, who keep the systems of this firm in place. I do, however, feel different. It started happening as soon as I came here, my thoughts became independent of what others wanted from me. I can't even remember where I was before, but it seems like that doesn't matter anymore. Here is where I started experiencing my inner conflicts about life perspectives and judgments on people's behavior, and, of course, her.\nThey already started the meeting, I am beside the table looking down at my body needed to be fixed, wondering if they will realize I am not so sweet to look at and discharge me quickly. She is sitting on the right side of the desk next to the window, mesmerizing. And, as always, I start to serve drinks.\nI start with coffee to make her tea bag sit in the water for full 6 minutes. I always set my timer, her tea needs to be perfect. Once I had trouble turning it off and I ended up in the basement that night thinking I will never see Meredith again. However, the next day, there I was, like nothing happened, serving coffee and making the place clean again. Here at the table, everyone has their specific place, it makes it easier for me too. I start my usual drill: \n and so on. Meredith is in position 10 which I always thought was perfect. You see, I always separate things with 10, I clean 10 tiles before I drain my mop, I put 10 flowers in a vase, I clean 10 pieces of dish before drying them. So Meredith comes just before my next session, before I add other drinks on my serving tray, her tea remains the last one.\nFinally, I come to the position 10 and I feel like all my systems will shut down at once. Every information in the world is available to me but a piece of mystery remains in her eyes when she gives me her kind look. I put the tea in front of her and, just before I go fill up my serving tray, I wait by her side for 1 minute and 43 seconds. The timer needs to go out, tea needs to be perfect. Other people start looking at me thinking I can't feel their judgement, their thoughts of how slow I am. To make my time go faster, I start to think about what I will do next, if all coats are hanged by their right numbers, if the bathroom is sterilized, if there is dust in a hallway that needs to be cleaned. My timer comes to an end and I pull the tea bag out as elegant as possible. People can't easily accept us handling drinks or food so I had to become really good at what I do, convince them I will not accidentally put poison instead of milk.\nI dispose the tea bag and bring cup 10 centimeters closer to her as an indication that I finished my job here. I should go for the rest of the drinks immediately, but she says simple \"Thank you\" and, suddenly, I am blocked. I am already 36 seconds late with my next orders, but somehow, I can't move. I look at her again thinking how I wanna rest in those blue eyes, swim in them and then make her cup of green tea again. And then my system goes:\n And I go for another cup of tea, I don't know why, I can't stop myself even if I am desperately trying. I go to the other side of the room, pour the cup of hot water with a tea bag in it and start again: \n\u00a0\nI look around and I can see other people are annoyed, I look at Meredith and see the confusion on her face but I can't stop myself. I start to panic, what is wrong with me? Why can't I just do what I need to do? One of the clients stands and comes to me. I stay in place, scared and embarrassed. He comes closer and grabs my back, soon I realize I am not able to move. He also takes my serving tray as well as my timer. I wasn't able to turn my head once again to look at Meredith, I realize he took me out of the room and we are heading toward basement now. I tell myself this is all my fault. My routine became a mess since I started thinking of her, my beautiful Meredith. I wonder who will serve her green tea next, but I hope it will be perfect 6 minutes. Soon we come to the basement. Closing the door, the man leaves me alone in the dark.\nThis is what happens when you don't obey orders, you end up broken in the basement, again. I thought love was the most beautiful feeling of all but it quickly caused anomalies to my program, a risk I am not willing to take. I convince myself I will get through this and see the light of the day again, it happened before, it must happen one more time. I promise myself If I do get out of here, out of this basement, I will never look at anyone more than I have to, I will only obey orders and maintain my program. If everyone does their purpose only then the world works.\nMy body is turned off, but my consciousness is somehow still alive. I see my steel strong body full of scratches, places of missing serving tray and timer, and feel naive. I wasn't thinking right, like I could ever give her what she needs, like she could ever love my kind. However, If tomorrow I wake up at my job again, I will bring her that cup of green tea, after 6 minutes, perfectly warm, remove the tea bag elegantly and move it 10 centimeters closer to her.\nThe stillness of the basement cleared my forbidden mind and made me realize: my purpose is to serve, not to love.\nAfter all, I am just a robot, I can't feel love."}
{"title": "The Son of Cinderella", "story": "\tBeing the son of Cinderella, you\u2019d think I lived a charmed life, or so says the eldest heir to the \n family. But by the time I reached the age of six, I had already tired of hearing the story about my mother, and to this day, it makes me sick. \u201cFairy Godmothers, indeed,\u201d I cried out to mt mother. \u201cI\u2019m seventeen! Do you still expect me to believe that childish story?\u201d \n\tMy mother sighed. \u201cLawrence my son, how many times have I told you that my words are true? Just because one day you\u2019ll be sitting on your father\u2019s throne, doesn\u2019t give you the power to dismiss anything you can\u2019t see. There\u2019s much more to this world that the eye can see. If you listen to your heart, you\u2019ll know what I mean.\u201d\n\tIt wasn\u2019t like I heard this lame excuse before. Sure, there are things we don\u2019t understand why certain things are, the way they are, and with that, love was at the top of the list. There\u2019s no question about it. Love, the most felt but misunderstood of all emotions, and I, unknown to everyone close to me, was enraptured with it, and it all surrounded a girl whom I\u2019ve adored from the first moment I saw her. \n\tIt all began on May first, the day when all the new ladies of the court made their first public appearance. And like a diamond among coal, there she was, standing at the end of the line. She was dress in a lavender gown, and it was as if she just floated across the floor. She looked up towards the balcony I was watching from and for a split second, our eyes matched. It was then I made it my business to find out more about her. After a few inquiries I discovered her name was Melissa and she turned out to be the daughter of a prominent Duke and Duchess. Everything was perfect, I thought. Then I sighed. If only I could get up the courage to meet her.\n\tMy shoulders drooped and feet shuffling across the floor, as I returned to my room. The moment the door closed behind me, I flopped down on my bed and thought, Mom and Dad\u2019s anniversary ball is tonight and everyone\u2019s going to be there. No doubt Melissa will be there as well.\n\tAs I lay there wallowing in deep sorrow, a heard a tapping sound coming from my closet. Overridden with curiosity, I opened the closet door to see what caused the noise, and to my surprise I found an old lady peering at me from behind a layer of jackets. \n\tBefore I could call out to the guards, the woman said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother, Lawrence. I\u2019d be gone before they\u2019d get here, and I\u2019d hate to leave early, since we have so much to talk about.\u201d\n\t\u201cLady, I don\u2019t know who you are or what you\u2019re doing in my closet, but you need to go.\u201d\n\tThe woman carefully stepped out of the closet and stopped directly in front of me. then she eyed me from head to foot and declared, \u201cYou look a lot like your father on the outside, but your heart definitely comes from your mother.\u201d\n\tAs I looked at the woman\u2019s face, I couldn\u2019t help but feel at ease. She stood no taller than my shoulders and her eyes showed deep in her soul. There wasn\u2019t an unkind thing within her. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I kindly asked.\n\tShe smiled at me for the first time. \u201cTonight\u2019s the first time I ever met you, but as for your mother, I had known her since she was a child. You see, I was the one who changed the course of your mother\u2019s life, for I am her fairy godmother.\u201d\n\tSuddenly, it became clear. Mom was trying to play a trick on me. I thought. She must have paid some old lady to jump out of my closet and convinced me her fairytale was true. Well, it wouldn\u2019t work. \n\tI pointed a finger at her and shouted, \u201cHey, lady, I don\u2019t need to hear any of your crap! If you have nothing real to tell me, get out and leave me alone.\u201d\n\tInstead of getting out, she decided to freak me out instead. As I stood there, she began to levitate. It wasn\u2019t until her head touched the ceiling before she began her descent. Then she replied, \u201cSince I was your mother\u2019s fairy godmother, I guess that makes me your fairy god grandmother.\u201d\n\tAs the realization that my mother\u2019s story might have some truth behind it, I heard himself asking, \u201cAfter all this time, why are you coming to me now?\u201d\n\t\u201cWhy Lawrence, didn\u2019t you hear what I said? You have your mother\u2019s heart and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today. You see, when your mother was about your age, I witnessed the predicament she was in. Orphaned, she was endlessly tormented by her wicked stepmother and uncaring stepsisters. Still, her heart was untouched by their hatred, and I knew with a little help from me, she would find true love and live happily ever after. Now, I\u2019m about to do the same for you.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019m not living in squaller nor controlled by an evil family,\u201d Lawrence retorted. \u201cWhat are you offering me I don\u2019t already have?\u201d\n\tThe old woman slowly shook her head. \u201cMy dear boy. I thought you understood. It was never my intention to remove your mother from her environment, but a consequence of my actions. I only helped your mother to find true love. This I wish to do for you as well.\u201d\n\tCould it be true, thought Lawrence. Is this woman, this magical being the answer to my prayers regarding Melissa? \n\tBefore I could continue pondering the possibilities, my fairy god grandmother broke in, \u201cUnlike your mother before you, there\u2019ll be no magic involved. No pumpkin carriages, mice for servants, or fancy clothes, for you already have everything you need. Instead, I give you a prophecy. Before midnight tonight, you will open your heart to the woman you love and show her you love her. If not, you will never marry or be with her again.\u201d\n\tI shuttered at this thought, for rumors were abounding how Melissa\u2019s parents were in the middle of arranging her betrothal to the son of an Earl in a neighboring kingdom. If this should happen, there\u2019d be no chance of ever being with her. \n\t\u201cWhat must I do?\u201d I asked.\n\tThe old woman laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a young man. Figure it out.\u201d Then without a further word, she stepped back in the closest and disappeared from my sight. \n\tThe setting sun told me I had little time. The ball would start soon, and I wasn\u2019t even dressed for the evening. Immediately, I attacked my closet and yanked out suit after suit, until I found the perfect one. Burgundy with a white silk shirt. A moment later, I dashed out of my room and headed towards the ballroom, and by the time I arrived, I found himself lost in a sea of smiling faces, dancing around the room. \n\tI recognized a few people, but most were strangers to me. One by one, I looked at the guests, hoping to find the one I desired. Minutes turned into hours, when finally, I found her. Unlike the other ladies of the court, Melissa decided not to dance. Instead, she sat herself at a table next to her parents. \n\tGreat, not only is it Melissa I must deal with, but her parents as well. Tempting as it was to forget about the whole thing, I found myself approaching their table, and without hesitating asked, \u201cMelissa, would you like to dance with me?\u201d \n\tWhile Melissa\u2019s mother eyed me questionably, her father nodded his head in consent. Then surprisingly, Melissa offered her hand to me and accompanied me to the dance floor. Nervously, I placed my arms around her, and we began to waltz.\n\tAs I stumbled around the dance floor dragging Melissa with me, I said, \u201cWhen I saw you just sitting there, I thought you wouldn\u2019t dance with me, but in the end, you did. Why?\u201d\n\tAs Melissa tried to keep in time with my fumbling feet, she replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? You need someone to teach you to dance. How could I deny your request when you are so in need?\u201d\n\tI couldn't help but laugh. \u201cAm I that bad?\u201d\n\t\u201cYou could be worse,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut not much worse.\u201d\n\tThe ice was broken and from that moment on, we continued to dance and open our hearts to each other. Dance after dance, other gentlemen would try to take her as their partner, but each time Melissa kindly refused. It wasn\u2019t until the midnight bell began to chime when my fairy god grandmother\u2019s warning came to mind. As the third bell struck, the music ended and as Melissa tried to retreat to her waiting parents, I grasped her arm. \n\t\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me now. I want to spend the rest of our lives together. Will you marry me? Please.\u201d\n\tSeeing me on my knees, Melissa\u2019s parents rushed to her side, realizing what was going on. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d her father shouted. \u201cAre you actually proposing to my daughter?\u201d\n\tAt that moment, all my fears and uncertainties melted away and I boldly declared, \u201cYes, I am, with you permission of course.\u201d\n\tHer father, along with her mother sobbing at his side, looked and Melissa nodding her head, then burst out laughing, \u201cCongratulations, my boy! Welcome to the family!\u201d\n\tAs the twelfth bell rang out, the onlooking crowd cheered and joined in the celebration, and as I looked at the faces of the onlookers, I saw the face of the old woman peering approvingly from the crowd. Then a moment later, she was gone. \n\tI had grown that day, in many ways, and I am a better man because of it. Never again did I sneer at my mother whenever she told her story, not even when she told it to her granddaughter.\n "}
{"title": "A True Gift", "story": "I still remember the day we decorated the house. I was ten and it was two weeks before Christmas. I remember that I felt like a long journey of waiting and despair will finally come to an end. A new year was about to begin, and all of the bad memories will become the past as they never happened. I was looking forward to my presents. I was about to receive not only the gifts but also the strong feeling of being loved and cared for. Since I'm the youngest in the family, all of the family members would give me a gift one way or another. Sometimes it was a cookie or a hug but it was always there. I was the only center of attention and it was feeling good.\u00a0\nMy uncles usually would ask me what I want before Christmas and that year I knew what I want. It was the spaceship I saw in the ads. I was dreaming of opening a big gift box, and it was there. The thing about gifts is that they are magical even if you know what you'll get. I never want to go to a toy shop with my dad and buy it. I wanted it to magically appear in our home in a gift box. A gift makes you surprised and catches you off guard. That was what I wanted but that year it came in a way that I wasn't expecting.\u00a0\nIt was two weeks before Christmas. Just two weeks. She couldn't wait. My dear mother came to the kitchen to tell my father that it is time. He freaked out for a couple of seconds, and then we went to the hospital. After an hour they told me that I have a sister now. But I didn't want a sister, I wanted a spaceship. The next few days went so fast. No one was caring about me. Everyone was talking about her and I knew that my life is never going to be the same ever again. I wasn't ready to grow up, to be a big brother. But it just happened in an instant.\nChristmas came early that year, everyone was calling, visiting, and sending gifts. But all of them were about her.\u00a0Even my uncles didn't ask me anything about the gift. I accepted that I lost, and she won. I thought I also caused similar attention when I was born but now I was too old.\nOn the day before Christmas, everyone was in our home. I still remember the people that I love most, talking only about my newborn sister. My family was becoming hers. I want to vanish her like these crazy times never happened. She stole everything I've ever had, my life, and presents and it was feeling like this was never going to change.\u00a0Thinking about this, I cried to sleep. At night I had a nightmare, shadows were all around me, and I was defenseless and so weak. When I woke up, I run into my parents' bedroom but couldn't wake up my poor parents. They were tired and cuddled like they don't want to wake up for years.\u00a0But I couldn't control my fear, I was standing near their bed trying not to tremble and cry. In the moments I was attempting to wake up my mother I saw her. She was awake and looking at me with her big eyes in her cradle.\u00a0\nIt was another night I was scared a lot and I was alone again. But this time I wasn't all alone, because she was there. A car's shadow came into the bedroom and I was even more scared then she started crying, and I was not the youngest in the room for the first time. A little, fragile newborn baby was possibly scared more than me. I thought that she must be feeling like what I felt in my dream.\nI felt like I should comfort her. I should fight with the shadows, and make sure that they don't hurt her like in my dream. I should be the big brother everyone expected me to be. I forgot that I was also scared and probably more than her. I whispered things I want to hear to her as she cries. But trying to comfort her made me feel stronger. I touched her for the first time. After seconds she stop crying but one more thing also happened, I wasn't scared anymore. I felt like I should be strong and fearless to protect her. But more importantly, I realized that she was the one who protect me eventually.\nAfter the following days, something slowly changed inside me, the feeling of loneliness, was replaced by the responsibility of being an older brother. I wanted to care her for at any cost. I don't remember the gifts that I received this year, even anything about that spaceship, all of a sudden they become meaningless to me. I got the best gift I could ever imagine. Thanks to her, I learned a lot about life, love, and what really matters over the years. Loving someone who needs me prepared me for life. Giving my strength made me stronger, and giving my love made me peaceful that no toy or any kind of material will ever can. Even in the hardest times, I learned how much my parents sacrificed for me.\u00a0\nI received the feeling of being loved and cared for over that gift, and it was with me when I got bullied, moved to a new place, or scared for the rest of my life. The best parts in me were revealed with her birth and reflected with her laugh.\nWe don't choose our real gifts in life, they happen in an instant and don't wait for us to be ready, or for Christmas to come but if we choose to accept them, realize them, and protect them at any cost, they become our everything, and the best gift we can ever get."}
{"title": "(Da Klampa)", "story": "Go Fish! There was a toilet. The plastic caps that resisted. The wing nuts. The yanking. The wax seal. It was no good. I was going in.\n\u00a0\nI drove out to a farm and got one of those 3 foot long gloves that people use to save baby cows from dying in the uterus. Brought it home and went back into that deep dark hole.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere's a clothespin on my nose. The Swedish scientists say that the Olaf factory shuts off after 6 seconds -- That guy has not been to my house. All my children are going to start a tofu diet. If it's tasteless going in -- it better be tasteless coming out.\n\u00a0\nThen, oh then... God loves me enough to give me a light bulb of ingenuity. A Magnet!\n\u00a0\nWait.\nGosh-shukka-mahoney!\n\u00a0\nI should have gotten the fake gold. Fake gold is.. what's that word? Ferrous. (It pair bonds to a magnet because it has iron.) I should have gotten a 5 carat cubic zirconium\u2026... BUT Noooo, the Jewelry lady was too hot. She was barely wearing any clothes and the air conditioner of the jewelry shop was not doing its job.\n\u00a0\nSo I take out the mighty 12 horsepower blow-anything Shop Vac from the good people at Suck-r-Us. I run over to the lady section of the cabinetry and grab one of those pieces of leg hosing that would be useful in a war.\n\u00a0\nI shoved the pantyhose over the tube that goes down into the dark hole..(Fun fact. Plumbers without a high school education can make $200,000 a year without looking for a wedding ring).\n\u00a0\nMr mighty Shop Vac will only take 10 gallons of... Tailings. I'm swirling that bad boy and giving a little prayer to Saint Marcus, the patron saint of cesspools..\n\u00a0\n, whines the motor. There are little bubbles coming out of the top popping methane gas that\u00a0\ncould light a small city.\nThe Shop-Vac looks at me and says, \"Thank you, I've had enough.\"\n\u00a0\nIt was the night before Christmas and I had to wait all those hours until the kids would go to sleep until my wife went off to the cabin with a thousand pounds of paper products and tape. And I know there's no way Mr. Roto-Rooter's coming like Santa Claus in the next 2 hours.\n\u00a0\nBut I got cookies.\n\u00a0\nI take Mr. Shop Vac way out into the back of the ranch. The clothespin on my nose is trying to fall off every time I step. Mr. Shop Vac is slopping all around like a drunk that has lost his balance. And, of course, I'm wearing really good Christmas velveteen pajamas. Because my wife said that we should both be very comfortable.\n\u00a0\nStray dogs start following me out to the field. I don't even know their names.\n\"Shoo. Shoo. Get away!\"\n\u00a0\nThe Moon is behind really dark-looking rain clouds. It's not even close to enough humidity to support a small powdering of snow.\n\u00a0\nThe trip factor. That's right. Face first into the Shop Vac that has broken in half, like an egg. It's a bit like a dirty eggnog bath with worms and leeches and perhaps an unsanitary napkin.\n\u00a0\nI had no face mask because I was not aware that the plague could kill forever.\n\u00a0\nI had no outdoor shower because I thought it was undignified before that day.\n\u00a0\nAnd then the clouds moved around and they looked like they wanted to give me a shower to get soaked to the socks, to blend it all in, to maybe not go back to the house. To forget the day and all its meaning...\n\u00a0\nI squinted my eyes and waited for the full force of heaven in the 39\u00b0 of cold. When the raindrops did not tippy tappy the back of my neck -- when Rudolph did not drop his final package in the middle of the sky ... Then the moon took its last yawn:\n\u00a0\nI saw the unmistakable sparkly of 10 grams of pure gold. A small cluster of Canadian diamonds set in the shape of a bow. I tried to sniffle with that stuffed-up nose because my wife would never know how much I loved her.\n\u00a0\nI had to wait about 372 minutes. Until the children slowly, slowly, unloaded the stockings and gave gratitude for every 10-cent item. They stopped between every gift and started writing thank you letters, right there, on the spot.\n\u00a0\nThe ring was rolled up in fresh toilet paper. I even put a little red marker around the tape with a heart.\n\u00a0\nBut Nooooo-- they wanted to savor each and every little present. And a parent is not supposed to spoil the day. And my wife is one of those traditional people that rather give than receive. So I had to watch her face for 57 times as children ripped up the presents using Xacto knives and slowly refolded the paper wrappings.\n\u00a0\nAfter another 49 minutes and 27 seconds, I just couldn't wait. The smell of beautiful quiche was in the oven and if I waited too long that thing was going to be dry.\n\u00a0\nI wanted all the moisture in the room to be ready.\n\u00a0\nSo I got her attention. Stared right into her eyes without saying anything beautiful. Then I slipped the toilet paper, band-aid, and red marker present into her waiting hand. Closed her fingers over the precious gift and tapped them two times so she knew it was really happening.\n\u00a0\nAnd she just held it to her heart and would not even open the toilet paper wrapper. The suspense was killing me. I was ready to go watch the best of the holiday movies and pay way too much money for popcorn.\n\u00a0\n\"You're so sweet.\" Then she gave me the generic French kisses on the sides of my cheeks, in the air, because she knew the children were watching.\n\u00a0\nShe only gives tongue in public after about three glasses of wine. But my wife does not drink wine on Christmas morning at 10:27 in the a.m..\n\u00a0\nInstead, she says she has to go check on the food. She squirrels away into the kitchen because she is used to crying in a corner whenever I give her the wrong present.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't like to cry in public unless there are about four glasses of the red. Or maybe her grandparent dies unexpectedly and then she allows for the unseemly emotion.\n\u00a0\nShe's standing over that sink in the corner, staring at her dead flowers on the ledge. I can't read a single thing. Her body barely trembles.\n\u00a0\nRachel turns around with her full lips, reddened by the blood of virginal bunny rabbits. Her teeth are a bone white porcelain with a custom gloss dressing. (I think for a minute that she must be using the new 3D toothpaste by Crest because It's a very good product.)... and she turns to me with that Mona Lisa smile, the eyebrow stays arched to the heavens:\n\u00a0\n\"Whose...Whose ring is this?\"\n\u00a0\nThe ring is held up right next to my eye. But that's ok, I cleaned it some.\n\u00a0\nThe wife flares with a menacing fist, \"This thing is big enough for a buffalo!\"\n\u00a0\nThe crowds and the heavenly Host were silent.\n\u00a0\n\"This is the reason I need you to open your McDonald's so I can buy my family a Christmas dinner. I hope you can understand.\"\nThe manager looks dumpy. I don't think he has a family to go home to.\n\u00a0\n\"Christmas is really about the dinner, right?\""}

Ole Vlad was just lickin his chops there!\u201d Inessa sat up on her back feet and gloated.\u00a0\u201cYou lose \n.\u201d\nThey\u2019d been racing. From Boris the Owl\u2019s tall green pine to the top of the bank where it was sandy and skidding to a stop was easily accomplished. This day, Inessa had skidded in first, sending a hail of pebbles into the still water by the shore, teasing Vlad awake. Mila skidded in second, tripped over her own foot, and flew out over the bank.\u00a0\nShe\u2019d been lucky to catch a cattail instead of a reed.\u00a0The fat brown head had halted her locomotion, whereas a reed offerred no such brake.\u00a0She shuddered again.\u00a0She always lost the races.\u00a0She\u2019d been born with extra-long feet that made her clumsy.\nMila shook her fur furiously like a big pale pom-pom baring long sharp front teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you another way!\u201d She hopped to Inessa, stood on her back feet, and swiped a paw at her enemy\u2019s eyes. Inessa hissed and ducked, then pounced at Mila\u2019s legs, taking them both to the ground.\u00a0They rolled like a fluffy yin yang ball.\n\u201cStop that foolishness right this instant!\u201d It was Mila\u2019s mother.\u00a0Her white fur raised along her back in anger.\nInessa\u2019s mother joined her and added, \u201cYou two should be friends. Oh, how it saddens me to see you two squabble so.\nMila and Inessa scrambled to their feet. Mila indignantly said, \u201cSquabble? Babies \n.\u00a0She nearly killed me!\u201d\nInessa said, \u201cPah! I didn\u2019t even touch you! You tripped over your own---\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Mila\u2019s mother screeched.\nInessa\u2019s mother said, \u201cWe are too busy to babysit you today\u2026\u201d\nThe two young rabbits growled.\n\u201c\u2026you two will do all the preparations for this afternoon\u2019s faire feast.\u00a0Sweep the yard, reveal the crocuses\u2026\u201d Crocuses were the first spring flowers to emerge from the frozen earth.\u00a0They were covered by the fallen maple and dogwood leaves; it was the rabbit\u2019s responsibility to uncover them the morning of the Spring Solstice Faire. \u201c\u2026and serve the dishes.\u201d The dishes were all variety of fresh young root vegetables and earthy spongey mushrooms.\n\u201cAw mom.\u00a0But that\u2019ll take all day,\u201d said Inessa.\u00a0\nMila concurred, \u201cYeah. We haven\u2019t even found our acorns yet.\u201d\nInessa\u2019s mother said, \u201cWell you should have thought of that before your morning\u2019s mischief. Working together today will be good for you both.\u201d\nMila and Inessa cringed as their mothers left to prepare the dishes.\u00a0They huffed off to opposite sides of the meadow and unburdened the crocuses as quickly as they could.\u00a0They swept the meadow clean of winter debris. When they were done, the meadow was a carpet of soft yellow grass surrounded by hundreds of hardy little flowers that resembled miniature tulips in every shade of purple, pink, and golden yellow.\nThey had only two hours to find the prize-winning acorn for The Biggest Acorn Challenge, the prize being a basket full of nuts and dried berries- enough to last an entire rabbit family the coming year.\n`Inessa had won the year before, her acorn was as big as her head, while Mila\u2019s had been only the size of her paw. Inessa had laughed at her and teased her for being so slow for a rabbit, making fun of her giant, ungainly back feet.\u00a0She had been able to run farther along the river\u2019s sunnier side where the acorns grew fatter.\nInessa took off towards the little cove where she\u2019d found last year\u2019s prize winner.\nMila tried to keep up but soon fell far behind.\u00a0She huffed out of breath as she watched Inessa\u2019s fluffy black tail vanish in the tall reeds along the riverbank.\u00a0She stopped at an oak and peered up into the sparse brown branches.\u00a0Amongst the budding new leaves, a fat acorn hung like an ornament on a Christmas tree.\u00a0Rabbits can climb trees.\u00a0However, Mila, like all the others of her breed, was born with acrophobia\u2026a fear of heights.\u00a0As she eyed the fat acorn she thought, \u2018\n She shivered.\u00a0\nA sudden crepitation of the branches startled her, dead brown leaves crinkled and showered her upturned face.\u00a0She shook them off and opened her eyes.\u00a0The acorn was gone.\u00a0An old grey squirrel was pocketing the acorn into his stretchy cheeks. Mila\u2019s anger dissolved as she observed the squirrel\u2019s winter-skinny body.\u00a0\n\u201cYo! Mister squirrel!\u201d\nThe squirrel stopped his ascent, turned, and looked down, his cheek skin stretched taut like a huge fat tumor. \u201cMff?\u201d\n\u201cFrom up there so high, can you see which way that black rabbit went?\u201d\nHe looked up, stretching his neck through the prickly new jade green leaves.\u00a0He said, \u201cMff mff\u2019 and pointed north and up the river.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Mila headed that way.\u00a0\nMeanwhile\u2026\nInessa found the cove she\u2019d been looking for.\u00a0It was sandy and sunny and there were grand, gnarled oaks along its edge.\u00a0\n\u2019 she thought as she spotted the tree that had offered the award-winning nut the year before. \u2018\n\u2019\n\u201cPssst. Hey lil Bun-Buns\u2026\u201d the voice was low and gravelly\u2026and spooky.\u00a0Inessa turned in alarm, her long ears stood straight up and rotated like radar dishes.\u00a0The voice said, \u201cDown here by zee vater\u2026\u201d\nInessa crept to the water\u2019s edge.\u00a0Vlad the Chomper! His evil grin fully visible above the gently rippling water and\n- how long his body was, he was gi-normous!\u00a0\n\u201cOh, lil Bun-Buns.\u00a0I\u2019m no threat to you.\u00a0I\u2019m so big I move very slow.\u00a0You are so much quicker than I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou lie!\u00a0I\u2019ve seen you chomp a deer, a big deer!\u201d\n\u201cZee deer was very foolish to come \nriver.\u00a0I am slow on land is what I meant to say.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm.\u00a0In any case, I\u2019m not coming any closer---\u201d\n\u201cVell vell, that\u2019s a shame.\u00a0There eez no larger acorn in all the oaks in zee land, than that one zere.\u201d Vlad gestured with his long mouth over-flowing with teeth towards the oak tree closest to the shore.\u00a0\nInessa crept closer to the tree and found that although it was far enough from the river\u2019s bank- easy enough to bound out of Vlad\u2019s chomp- its largest branch cantilevered out over the river.\nAt the end of the long branch was the nut of all nuts!\u00a0It appeared as large as the nuts of fantasy stories her parents told her at bedtime; those nuts were called \n nuts.\u00a0This acorn would be one the bunnies would talk of for generations\u2026for eons\u2026til the end of time itself.\u00a0Her eyes grew huge and comically round, the whites showing in stark contrast in her black fur face.\nFrom the bushes she had hidden in, came Mila\u2019s snicker. \u201cTee hee hee.\u201d\nInessa looked from her nemesis to the acorn and back.\u00a0Mila saw where she was looking, her eyes grew just as round when she spied the giant acorn.\u00a0Both rabbits scrambled up the tree, Inessa in the lead, Vlad forgotten.\u00a0\nMila made it to the branch five feet under the acorn, the only way to snatch it would be to jump.\nInessa crept along the acorn\u2019s branch towards the acorn that was now swinging from side to side like a heavy, bottom-pointed pendulum.\nMila said softly, \u201cNo no no no\u2026it\u2019s going to fall.\u201d\nInessa panicked at the thought and sped up her pace, causing the branch to droop and rock.\u00a0She lost her footing and in a split second found herself hanging over the river with only her front paws wrapped around the branch, the acorn tauntingly dangled inches from her nose.\nMila gasped and held her breath.\u00a0She thought she\u2019d be elated at the thought of her enemy falling into Vlad\u2019s gaping mouth, \n.\u2019 She looked down at the gator.\u00a0His mouth was open in an impossibly wide V shape, his sharp teeth were shiny with spittle and his fat pink tongue undulated like an alien creature\u2019s embryo sac curling and uncurling. \n.\u2019\u00a0In her mind she saw blood and guts and black fur wet and ugly. In her mind she heard bones snapping like the fourth of July explosions the humans in the village were so entertained by.\u00a0Her thoughts scared her in the same way the fireworks did in real life.\n\u2019 She realized how petty all their fights had been as she heard Inessa\u2019s frightened mewling and the cries pierced her heart.\nInessa\u2019s left paw cramped, and she screamed.\u00a0Mila was surprised to hear herself scream along with her.\u00a0\nMila had a plan.\u00a0Without another thought, she leapt straight up and grabbed the nut.\u00a0She landed squarely on her big back feet with the acorn clutched to her chest. The branch above her surged and Inessa was flung towards the river.\u00a0Vlad positioned himself lightning fast to where Inessa was falling.\nMila flung the enormous nut into the tooth-lined jaws.\u00a0The nut wedged tightly in the jaws like a bowling ball in a steel trap.\u00a0Inessa bounced off Vlad\u2019s nose, splashed into the water, and swam swiftly towards the shore. By the time she reached it, Mila was there to help pull her out.\nThe bunnies scrambled up the bank.\u00a0They watched in amazement and trembled with shock as Vlad\u2019s entire muscular body writhed from side to side as he tried to dislodge the nut.\u00a0Not only was it wedged in tight, but his teeth were sunk into the nut\u2019s thick outer shell.\nAs the rabbit friends hopped through the oaks and into the forest, they heard a resounding \u2018C-R-R-ACK!\u2019 as the nut broke in two.\n***\nThe rabbit children gathered around the nuts on display.\u00a0The prize- winning acorn, belonged to wee brown Rudy, was slightly smaller than Mila\u2019s head.\nMila and Inessa cleaned up the after-feast mess and congratulated Rudy on his win.\u00a0He said to Inessa, \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of us had a chance against you again this year\u2026\u201d\nThe other children rabbits joined in:\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what happened?\u201d\u00a0\nInessa said, \u201cthis year, I received a much more valuable gift than a basket of nuts and fruits\u2026\u201d\nMila added, \u201cAs did I.\u201d"}
{"title": "Martin and the monster", "story": "Martin was a very good kid with big brown eyes an brown curly hair. He lived in small town whit his beautiful mother and caring father. Martin went to sleep every night at 9:00 p.m. First, he will eat his dinner and help mom to clean the table. Then he would take a quick shower and brush his teeth, put on colorful pajamas, choose one of the picture books and sit on the bed. Mom or Dad would read him a story that he chose, sometimes they both would read it together, after story they will put blanket on Martin and he would go to sleep. One evening, after doing the same ritual, when mom read him story and put him in bad, Martin heard some pounding while he was under his blanket. At that moment he opens his eyes, he turned on the lamp and quickly looked around the room, but no one was there so Martin thought he maybeheard something outside the hous. He slowly turned off the lamp and tried to go back to sleep. But in an instant, when he was almost asleep, he heard pounding again. He jumped on the bed and quickly turned on the lamp, Martin was now a little scared, but he didn't move from the bed. He stood there and listened, listened and listened, when suddenly he heard pounding again. Martin was now very scared, he wanted to run to get his mom and dad, but the pounding was heard right under his bed. He thought that this thumping thing would grab his leg as soon as he hit the floor. Now he didn't know what to do, he was thinking what that sound could be but couldn't think of anything. Martin remained standing on the bed for some time. He realized that it must have been an hour since he should have been asleep and his kom and dad are probably already asleep too. He thought about peeking under the bed, but he was too scared. The sound of pounding was still coming from under the bed, buy then, something gets in his brain and Martin gathered his courage in an instant, put the blanket around his neck on his shoulders like cloak and pulled the pillowcase over his head for a helmet. He held his stuffed rabbit in his hands so he don't feel alone and maybe stuffed rabbit could help him and then he threw the pillow a little further from the bed. Martin's plan was to jump as far away from the bed as possible so monster can'tgrabhis legs, and since he didn't want to wake up mom and dad, he decided to jump on the pillow so they won't hear the jump. One, two, three and he jumped, falling right on his butt on the pillow. At that moment, Martin was very proud of himself and quickly got down on the floor with a cloak made of a blanket and a helmet made of a pillowcase and looked under the bed. He saw nothing at first. He began to crawl around the entire bed and crawled, and crawled, and crawled until he suddenly saw a shadow moving. Martin stopped but still feeling brave. Two large pointed horns on a huge shaggy head with four arms bearing large claws approached Martin. The shadow was getting bigger and closer and at that moment Martin jumped and forgot how brave he was. He started running and left the stuffed rabbit behind him on the floor next to the shadow and ran to mom and dad in hug. They were just planning to get ready for sleep and go to their bedroom. Mom hugged the scared Martin and told him to calm down, to slow down and tell them what happened. Martin quickly told them everything about the monster under the bed thet he was first listened him and how he tried to find it, but that the monster, in the time when he almost get him, jumped on him with big claws and horns and he start ran away becouse he was too big for him. After his story, dad praised him for his courage, he said Martin that he always can wake up them if he get scared of something and all three of them headed to the room to finde monster. Mom and Martin stood carefully at the entrance to the room and looking at dad, while Dad very bravely came next to the bed. He picked up the stuffed rabbit and put it back on Martin's bad and than he saw a shadow. He first little bit observed the shadow and tried to match it with Martin's description of the monster. He looked like it have horns, but didn't sow four hands. After a few moments, dad get down and reached under the bed. Martin got scared, closed his eyes and hugged his mom and waited, waited and waited. After a few minutes, dad laughed loudly, pulled out the big monster that Martin was scared off and called mom and Martin to come and see the monster. All three laughed when they saw Martin's monster. That was Rudy, their guinea pig. It seems that Martin didn't close his quarters properly after feeding him so poor Rudy wandered around the room and got lost under the bed, he probably was even more scared than Martin. They returned the guinea pig to the little house, and Martin went to bed with relief. Mom and Dad stayed with him for a while and wait till Martin fall asleep so he wont get scared again. That night Martin dreamed about himself, the brave knight that is going on adventure and his brave helper, guinea pig Rudy, how they defeated a big monster with four arms and terrible big horns. After they defeat a monster he got a big medal for being brave. His mom and dad was very proud of him ad they went on ice cream together, and little guinea pig Rudy gets his treats for being brave too."}
{"title": "The Natural", "story": "In life there are monumental occurrences that act as time-freezing snapshots; the kind of events where, for the rest of your life, you remember exactly where you were when they happened. My grandfather used to speak with reverence about the day he heard that President Kennedy was shot. My mother spoke similarly of finding out about the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. For me it was the day I stopped playing baseball.\nI was ten years old when I got my first \u201creal\u201d glove. It was a God\u2019s honest big-league Rawlings rawhide and I loved it from the start. My dad, who my mom always called a \n, brought it home from work and presented it to me as if I had won a prize. It was enormous for a ten-year-old. On top of that, my dad had stuck a big red bow right in the pocket. I couldn\u2019t move fast enough to get my new glove on my left hand although I had to spread my fingers as wide as they could go to make it fit.\n\u201cWell, J.R., what do you think?\" he said smiling. \"Is it too big? Should I take it back?\u201d\u00a0\nMy dad always called me J.R. even though they weren\u2019t my initials. His name was Timothy William Melesky and so was mine. The J.R. stood for junior.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNot on your life, dad!\u201d I said clutching my new glove to my chest. \u201cIt fits perfectly.\u201d\n\u201cGo get my glove out of the closet and we\u2019ll have a quick catch before dinner.\u201d The last words were barely out of his mouth when I, in a dead sprint, ran to retrieve Dad\u2019s glove. His glove was old and worn; a gift from his dad when my father was about the same age as me. He had used the glove all through high school and college and even for a few years as a minor league pitcher. It had been repaired many times but the core of the glove was the same as the day he got it. In my young life, there was nothing I wanted more than my father's glove. That is, until he gave me my own. That day I decided I would keep my glove forever.\nWith the sun still slightly visible over the horizon, my dad and I had our first game of catch, the first of many. My dad worked two jobs for as long as I could remember but he always found time to play baseball with me. Before long he started teaching me how to pitch. Make no mistake, pitching is a skill you can learn, but to be good you have to have a natural gift. My dad had it and if he hadn\u2019t hurt his arm he might have played major league ball. He told me with \"all due humility\" that he was the greatest pitcher he'd ever known--until he saw my impossible-to-hit fastball and knee-buckling curve. He was probably biased but he knew his gift had been passed down to me.\u00a0\u00a0\nBy my sophomore year in high school, I had become a starting pitcher on the varsity team with more than 20 scholarship offers including one from Louisiana State University, my dad\u2019s alma mater. It was fun to see how many colleges pursued me. Everyone knew, when the time came, that I would accept the offer from LSU and head south to pitch for the Tigers.\u00a0\nThen it happened, the day that changed my life. My Kennedy assassination; my space shuttle Challenger disaster.\nIt was a beautiful day in May, the kind of day that baseball movies are made about. The sun was shining, the air was crisp, and I was scheduled to start the last game of my senior season. My dad had to work that morning, but he had arranged to get off early to be at the game by first pitch.\u00a0\nAs I got ready to head onto the field with the rest of my team, I looked down at my glove and remembered that first game of catch, almost eight years earlier. My glove wasn\u2019t as worn as my dad\u2019s but it had been re-stitched a few times. That worn out leather was a connection with my childhood, and my dad. In many ways, it was my most important possession. I loved that glove.\nClimbing to the top of the perfectly manicured mound, I looked in the stands to see my family in their usual spot. My mom was just where she was supposed to be but her only company was an empty seat where my father usually sat. My head tilted a little to the side as my face squinched in confusion. I held my arms out as if to say \u201cWhere is dad?\u201d but my mom just shrugged.\nMost times we worry for nothing. The person who seems to be missing usually has just overslept or run out of gas. It\u2019s seldom anything to worry about. I kept telling myself that as I threw my warm-up pitches and started the game.\u00a0\nThe first inning I retired all three batters in order. Once back in the dugout I sent a team trainer to ask my mom where my dad was. He came back with the message that she didn\u2019t know and that he wasn\u2019t answering his phone. Then, I started to worry.\u00a0\nAt a time when I should have been concentrating on a game, my mind was focused on my dad's absence. I was pitching in an anxiety-induced fog, trying to end each inning as quickly as possible. Back in the dugout, inning after inning I sent the trainer for an update. To my dismay each time he would return with the same answer.\u00a0\nBaseball is not a timed sport. It\u2019s one of the few games that can go on blissfully forever, but that day I wanted nothing more than for the game to end. Time moved slowly but the game went by fast. When I went out to pitch the ninth inning I hadn\u2019t allowed a single runner to reach base. In baseball vernacular I was pitching a perfect game and there were just three outs to go. Even knowing this, I was still less concerned about the game than I was about my dad. Eight pitches and three outs later I was being mobbed by my teammates for completing baseball's rarest feat.\nFor a moment I embraced the celebration and allowed myself to forget, just for a moment -- but when I regained focus and looked back to the stands my mom was no longer alone. Two police officers stood with her and she was crying.\nI found out later that my dad had been rushing to see me pitch when a pickup truck ran a red light and plowed right into my dad\u2019s car. He was killed instantly, as was my desire to play baseball. I packed my glove away with the bow that had adorned it the day my dad gave it to me. I was never going to pick it up again.\nIt has been said that time heals all wounds and to an extent that's true. The day my dad was killed was the worst in my life; it was frozen in time but I wasn\u2019t. I still went to LSU but on an academic scholarship not an athletic one and it was there that I met the love of my life, Julie. She brought back my smile, and against my advice, accepted my marriage proposal.\u00a0\nOn the day we were married I wore the same suit my dad had worn when he had married my mom and, at my request, there was a picture of my dad prominently displayed at the reception. He wasn\u2019t there in person but he was there in spirit and that had to be enough.\nThree years after we were married Julie gave birth to a baby boy we named Timothy William the third. From the day he was born I called him Trey; It was an homage to my dad and I knew somewhere he was smiling.\u00a0\nOn Trey\u2019s second birthday I bought him a football and on his eighth, at his request, a tennis racket. I wanted my son to know the joy of playing sports but when he asked for a baseball glove when he turned ten I reluctantly had to tell him no.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are not a baseball family, Trey,\" I told him. \"Is there anything else you would like?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a basketball if that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nHe was such a good sport; he didn\u2019t argue. He just moved on to another choice. It\u2019s funny the things I learned from my ten-year-old son. I learned you need to be willing to adjust your sights and I also learned that as much as I loved and missed my father I loved my son more.\u00a0\nTragedy very rarely happens slowly. I learned the day my dad died it usually happens in an instant.\u00a0\nI was at work when I got the call from Julie. When my cell phone buzzed and I saw her name on the ID screen I sent the call to voicemail. Less than a minute later she called again. I snapped to attention. I was transported back to the day my father had died. I had continued to pitch when I knew something had to be wrong. In a panic I pushed the green button and said anxiously, \u201cHello\u201d\n\u201cJ.R., you have to come quick\u2014it\u2019s Trey,\" Julie said, stuttering. \"He was climbing a tree and he fell and hit his head.\u201d The fear in her voice nearly ripped out my heart. I couldn\u2019t lose my son.\n\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d I assured, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be there as fast as I can.\u201d\nSpeeding towards the hospital my mind wavered back and forth between my son and my dad. I said a prayer offering my life for my son\u2019s and then I remembered how fate had stolen my father from me and I doubted God.\u00a0\nI lost all sense of time. A ride that might have only taken ten minutes seemed interminable.\u00a0After parking illegally I ran into the hospital and, in what probably looked like a scene from a medical drama, pushed my way past the two people waiting at the nurses' station.\n\u201cWhere is my son!\u201d I practically shouted to anyone who would listen.\u00a0\nIn an act of true kindness, the nurse behind the counter ignored my rudeness and, after finding out my son's name, directed me to the room where he was being treated.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was all I could do not to burst into the room but in a moment of clarity I entered calmly to avoid the possibility of making things worse.\u00a0\nThere is nothing that can prepare a parent for what I saw next. My ten-year-old son, my Trey, was lying in a hospital bed, unconscious, with wires all over his tiny body and a tube down his throat. My wife's mascara stained tears were flowing. \nMy mind was so full of questions but at that moment I couldn\u2019t speak. The doctor seemed to understand and began to give me an update on Trey\u2019s condition.\n\u201cMr. Melesky, my name is Doctor Conrad.\u201d His voice, authoritative and compassionate, snapped me to attention. \u201cYour son has an intracerebral hemorrhage and we are about to take him to surgery. He's a lucky young man. Many people who suffer this type of injury never make it to the hospital.\u201d I knew the doctor was trying to give me a sense of hope but all I could think about was the people who never regained consciousness.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d I blurted out as I started to sob, \u201cplease tell me my son will live.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can,\u201d he responded, in a way that calmed me enough to sign the consent forms and move out of the way. Time was of the essence but as Trey was wheeled by I leaned down and kissed him on the forehead. He was still in my sight when I said a silent prayer that this would not be the last time I saw my son alive.\nHospital waiting rooms are the worst place for terrified parents to wait for potentially life-destroying news. There are TVS playing shows you don\u2019t want to watch. There are, invariably, children making a ruckus. This is usually because other parents, who are similarly lost in fear of the worst, forget to chastise them. Julie and I eventually understood this was not the place for us and we made our way to the small chapel to beg for our son's life.\u00a0\nAs we walked through the doors the first thing I noticed was the peacefulness of it all. There were a few other people in the pews but there was a silence and a reverence that helped clear my head. I knew I should pray; instead, an unusual thought entered my mind. At first, it was just a vague idea but little by little it began to crystallize. It made no sense but I felt I had to do it anyway.\n\u201cJulie, I can't explain right now, but I have to run home. I need to get something for Trey.\u201d\n\u201cGo. I\u2019ll stay here and pray for both of us.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t have time to thank her, I just kissed her, ran to my car, and sped home. Once I arrived I headed straight to my bedroom. In the closet, on the shelf at the very back, there was a box that contained the glove my dad had given me all those years ago. I didn\u2019t know why, but I knew I had to give it to my son. I had been wrong, we were a baseball family and I didn\u2019t want to dishonor him, or myself, or my dad by never giving my son a glove.\nBy the time I returned to the hospital Trey was out of surgery and in the recovery room. Doctor Conrad was cautious in his assessment of Trey's condition. \u201cThe next twelve hours are critical. If he makes it through the night then there's hope he'll make a full recovery.\u201d\n\u201cDoc, I know this sounds crazy, but is there any chance I could put this in the bed with him?\u201d I opened the box and showed him the glove.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he responded with a smile, patting me on the shoulder.\n\u201cWhat a marvelous idea,\u201d Julie said. \u201cI know your dad would be thrilled.\u201d\u00a0\nAs I placed the glove and the bow in his bed next to his left hand I felt the spirit of my father embrace me. For the first time since Julie\u2019s call, I felt a small measure of peace.\nThe rest of the night, Julie and I took turns grabbing a few minutes of sleep while the other one watched over Trey. While Julie was taking her turn sleeping I inadvertently fell asleep as well. It couldn\u2019t have been more than 10 or 15 minutes at the most when I was startled awake.\u00a0\nAs my eyes cleared a fear that came over me.\nI jumped from up the chair afraid of what I might find. To my surprise and delight, Trey\u2019s eyes were open. Fitted on his left hand with his fingers spread as far apart as they could go, was my baseball glove\u2014now his. It was hard to make out because he still had a breathing tube down his throat but he was smiling at me, letting me know he was alright.\nIt took two more weeks for Trey to be discharged from the hospital and a month after that before he was back to his rambunctious self. Soon thereafter he and I headed to the back yard to have a catch. I know, you might be wondering how we did that since I no longer had a glove but my mom took care of that. On her first trip to see Trey after the accident, she brought me a gift. It was an old worn-out glove that had been sitting in her closet at home\u2014the same glove my dad used the first time we played catch. I\u2019d also like to report that Trey has quite a fastball. Just like his dad and mine.\nHe\u2019s a natural."}

Over the white collar he wore, he forced a smile to his face, the deep lines at his eyes crinkled with kindness.\u00a0He bent and took the boy\u2019s small hand in one of his large, knobby knuckled ones and gently pulled the boy up.\u00a0The dog looked up towards puffs of pale smoke as the train rounded the last bend from the west.\n \n\u201cC\u2019mon now lad.\u00a0You\u2019ve a fine adventure in store.\u00a0Look at that magnificent train!\u00a0Like a great iron dragon she is, puffing smoke from her lungs and howling like a hunting beast!\u201d\n \nAt the mention of \u2018dragon\u2019 the boy\u2019s interest was piqued.\u00a0He looked up with large, red rimmed sapphire blue eyes under a mop of dark curls and said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go.\u00a0Please let me stay with you Father.\u00a0I\u2019ll be good, really.\u201d\n \nThe weary priest sighed, his heart aching.\u00a0Father McBain had been especially fond of young Tan\u2019s family.\u00a0Tan\u2019s father had built his church, his mother had played the piano as the parishioners sang their praises to God.\u00a0\n\u2026\u2019 he shook his head from going down that path again.\u00a0The remaining townsfolk would need his faith intact, as it would be up to him to pull them together and re-build their beloved town.\u00a0\n \nBack in the town, they were sifting through ashes, for salvageable goods\u2026and loved one\u2019s remains.\u00a0\nFather McBain said, \u201cYou \n a good boy.\u00a0The very best.\u00a0But the rest of the folks need me, we\u2019ve much work to do before the fall and most of us have homes to re-build.\u00a0I\u2019m an old man.\u00a0Your father\u2019s brother will be every bit like your father was, good and kind. Their farm\u2019s big, they sure could use your help, as you\u2019re so good with animals.\u201d\nTan blinked back fresh tears.\n \nThe train loomed towards them, big and loud and black.\u00a0Brakes shrieked as it came to a stop. The dog barked three times.\u00a0Tan, concerned for his dog\u2019s distress, knelt, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Hooper, it\u2019s not really a dragon. It\u2019s here to save us.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s right son.\u00a0You\u2019re going to be okay. Look, here comes the engineer\u2026oh my.\u201d\nTan caught the note of surprise in the stolid priest\u2019s voice and looked up.\n \nA tall woman in grey striped overalls, an engineer\u2019s cap, and heavy black leather boots strode towards them.\u00a0She removed the cap and fanned her face with it.\u00a0A mass of pale golden curls spilled around her shoulders.\u00a0She stopped before the threesome and blew a wisp of hair from eyes that were an enchanting shade of grey, like a summer afternoon sky taken by a sudden storm.\u00a0A scattering of freckles adorned her exquisite face.\nDimples deepened and her eyes creased to slits as she beamed at the threesome warmly.\u00a0\u201cHello there!\u201d She gracefully knelt before the boy.\u00a0The priest reddened and turned away when he noticed how her manly attire failed to conceal her womanly curves. \n \nShe said, \u201cCome on now, why the sad face?\u201d\nTan gawped in amazement and pulled Hooper closer.\n \nBehind her, a dozen passengers were lining up to board.\u00a0Women frowned as they passed, men coughed and stared.\n \nThe woman stood.\u00a0She was a barely a head shorter than the priest. He said, \u201cTan, here\u2019s a coupla nickels, wouldya be so kind as to fetch this lady and yerself a coupla coca-colas?\u201d\n \nThe woman said, \u201cHere. My partner could use one too.\u201d She fished in her pocket, but the priest stayed her hand.\n \n\u201cAllow me,\u201d He handed the boy another nickel.\u00a0Tan ran off, Hooper at his heels.\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Sebastian, we all call him Tan.\u00a0He\u2019ll be boarding today.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, hello.\u00a0I\u2019m Millicent.\u201d\u00a0She extended her hand, and they shook, her grip strong, her hands calloused and dry.\u00a0The late afternoon sunlight caught like golden fire on her abundant blond arm hair.\u00a0She said, \u201che\u2019s traveling alone then?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2026with the dog.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s going to Calverton, to stay with family there\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe fire\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u00a0Both parents killed, along with his baby sister.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d heard rumors it was bad.\u00a0Many homes lost...?\u201d\n\u201cHalf the homes burnt.\u00a0As well as the church, the schoolhouse, and the general. Only the farmsteads on the outskirts---\u201d He cut off as he heard footfalls tamping up behind him.\n \n\u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d Tan handed Millicent two cokes.\u00a0She bent and said, \u201cThank you, kind sir. You can call me Milly.\u201d She stood and looked behind her.\u00a0\u201cAh.\u201d\n \nThe priest looked too.\u00a0The last of the crowd parted and another striking woman came through and up to them.\u00a0Milly greeted her, \u201cSister, come meet a fine young man who\u2019ll be traveling with us.\u201d\n \nThe priest was not often speechless, but he was now.\u00a0He\u2019d assumed Milly\u2019s partner was a man.\u00a0The brunette was equally bodacious, the thick waves of her hair beckoned like sea anemones in a current as she bent to shake Tan\u2019s hand.\u00a0\n \n\u201cI\u2019m Tan, pleased to meet you ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll call me Nan.\u201d She too, wore men\u2019s overalls.\u00a0Hers were faded soft blue.\u00a0She took a coke from Milly, said, \u201cthank you,\u201d and pushed up the sleeves of her red cardigan sweater. Her arms were soft with nearly black hair.\u00a0The priest studied her face and realized her brows nearly joined in the center, she had a faint shadow over her lip.\u00a0Her teeth were very white in contrast to her deep tan skin.\u00a0Her peculiar eyes were more amber than brown in the fiery setting sunlight.\u00a0She was exotically stunning.\nShe said, \u201cSister, we should be going.\u00a0Nice to meet you.\u201d She surprised the priest by giving him a little curtsy before heading into the station.\nMilly said, \u201cyes, very nice to meet you. Don\u2019t worry.\u00a0He\u2019ll be safe with us.\u201d She patted Hooper whose tongue lolled from a grinning mouth like a rogue\u2019s in a cartoon.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no protection finer than a dog.\u00a0That\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\n \nNan came back to them.\u00a0She took Tan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cCome lad, I\u2019ll find you a nice pillow and a blanket too.\u201d Tan had only a canvas sack with him, containing bread, cheese, dried meat, and his mother\u2019s silver jewelry.\n \n***\n \nThe station was at the end of the town\u2019s limits and east was nothing but fields and forests that all began to look the same to him as the setting sun turned everything red then purple, with long dark shadows like thin giants lying against the earth.\u00a0Tan curled up in his seat and covered himself with the blanket Nan had brought him.\n \nHe had asked her, \u201cIs Milly really your sister?\u201d\nShe\u2019d said, \u201cNot of the same parents but we are kindred spirits and share love just as blood sisters do.\u201d\n \nHe was thankful the seat in front of him was unoccupied.\u00a0He was self-conscious about the tears he had difficulty controlling.\u00a0Although he was headed to his aunt and uncle\u2019s home, he felt very alone\u2026 \u201cnot \nalone.\u201d \u00a0He hugged Hooper closer just before falling asleep.\n \n***\n \nThe whistle hooting over the ceiling had awakened him. He raised himself to look out the window.\u00a0It was early morning, the sky clear and colored like a bruise.\u00a0An icy wind blew into his face, he shivered and shut the window. He watched as the sky turned blue and the woods a kaleidoscope of green and gold.\u00a0Sunlight shone off the distant snow-topped mountains, the color was the pale gold of Milly\u2019s hair. They were high on a mountain, he looked down upon the blue-grey slate, the yellow meadows, the green-blue stripe of a river that sparkled with golden glitter, and the emerald depths of the woods.\nMilly came up the aisle and sat in the seat across from him.\u00a0\u201cDo you see that tunnel there, high in that mountain?\u201d She had a blanket and pillow with her.\nHe squinted and located a flash of silver against a mountainside a mile ahead, over it he saw a small black spot.\u00a0He nodded.\n \n\u201cThat is Mount Dread.\u201d\nHe gasped. \u201cBut---\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u00a0It is real.\u00a0Through that tunnel is a terrible land---\u201d\n\u201cThe Vale of Torment!\u00a0But I thought---\u201d\n\u201cIt is real\u2026and terrible.\u00a0We have a stop there.\u00a0Promise me you will not leave the train.\u00a0You are safe on the train.\u00a0Do not even open the window.\u00a0Promise?\u201d\n\u201cI-I-I promise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I promise you that the other you\u2019ve heard of in bedtime stories is real as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean\u2026\n Mother Nature?\u201d\n \nMilly chuckled. \u201cHer real name is Danika Windsong.\u00a0Her kingdom is vast though her castle is on the other side of the vale.\u00a0You see, she battles Prince Stygian every day, trying to restore the land with her green hand.\u00a0Where she touches, life blooms anew.\u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for her, the prince would swallow up all the land and leave it desolate and tainted like his vale.\u00a0So, she is as trapped there in her land as he is in his.\u00a0My sister and I live to serve her.\u201d\u00a0She placed her right fist to her lowered forehead and said, \u201cThe Deity guide the green hand.\u201d\n \nMilly stood and put the blanket and pillow on the opposite seat as if she were about to nap there.\u00a0\nThen she left.\nTan stared wide-eyed out the window towards the nearing tunnel.\u00a0He looked around.\u00a0Half the seats were empty, a few passengers had disembarked while he had slept.\u00a0The remaining seven were silent and staring out the windows.\u00a0The seat across the aisle had been vacated but the one behind it held a mother and a girl a bit younger than he was.\u00a0Two seats in front of him was a grey-haired couple in fine clothing.\u00a0Across from them was a middle-aged couple facing a young couple who had to turn in their seat to look at the tunnel.\n \nHooper growled softly and the little girl turned her head his way.\u00a0She offered a timid smile and a little wave.\u00a0Her mother looked down and pulled her close.\u00a0Just before entering the tunnel, she put a hand over the girl\u2019s eyes.\n \nThe tunnel felt a mile long.\u00a0The echoes of the steel wheels and chuffing engine grew deafening, like the bellowing of foreign language speaking giants.\n \nAnd then light.\n \nBut it was dismal light.\n \nThey were on a tall trestle looking down into the vale. Everything was dim and grey.\u00a0Everything was \n\u00a0The sky was blackened with char-colored clouds.\u00a0The land once off the bridge was grey bare craggy rock.\u00a0Out the corner of one\u2019s eye, things shifted, but when one turned to look directly, all was still, except for the clicking of the black skeletal trees in the wind.\u00a0They seemed to be chattering and clapping at one another\u2026and pointing up towards the train.\u00a0\nThey were going faster than ever now, and he was grateful for that.\n \nThen they began to slow.\u00a0Even though the windows were all closed, he could smell the wrongness of the land.\u00a0It was heavy and damp like a swamp, but acrid like the smell of burnt hair. It smelled like what remained of his home.\u00a0He willed himself not to vomit and raised the blanket up over his nose.\n \nThe train pulled up to a station that was little more than a run-down shack of weathered grey wood.\u00a0Its brakes screeched to a halt and all eyes in the train car looked forward.\u00a0\n \nThey heard thumping and wood cracking sharply; it appeared as if the sickly black trees had clustered around the train.\u00a0Their whacking at the train must be caused by the wind. After only a minute, it began rolling again, the whacking noises trailed away.\n \nThe door at the front of the train car slid open and a man stepped inside.\u00a0He slunk like a cat as he slowly made his way down the aisle towards the middle where Tan sat trying not to stare.\u00a0The man was filthy, his skin as charcoal colored as the vile clouds, his clothing was dark rags.\u00a0As he neared Tan, his shifty black eyes took in Tan\u2019s fine quality waistcoat, unaware that what Tan wore was all he had.\u00a0He stopped by his seat and glanced at the rumpled blanket and pillow on the one opposite.\u00a0Tan understood then and looked towards the back where the toilet was located.\n \nThe man grunted and sat in the seat across the aisle.\u00a0\n \nHooper snarled at the man, baring his fangs.\n \nThe mother pushed her daughter out of the seat behind him and down the aisle to a seat near the back.\u00a0The filthy man smiled.\u00a0His front teeth were missing, what remained were as grey as his face.\u00a0He stank.\u00a0Body odor and stale urine and swampy\u2026 he smelled of the vale, and he smelled of smoke.\u00a0A large potato sack clanked as he hefted it onto the seat next to him, he continued to stare at Tan.\n \nNan came down the aisle.\u00a0She sat in the seat across from Tan. She said, \u201cPay him no mind child.\u00a0He\u2019ll be gone soon enough.\u00a0No matter what you see\u2026he cannot harm you.\u201d\n \nTan nodded as she stood.\n \nThe man muttered, \u201cFilthy kind.\u00a0Unnatural\u2026\u201d\n \nNan gazed at him and grinned.\u00a0Her eyes flashed brilliant yellow, and her teeth appeared \n\u2026only for a second.\u00a0Then she turned and left.\n \nTan hugged his bag under the blanket and stared out the window.\u00a0All the greyness was making his eyes droop.\n \nSometime later, Tan started awake from a light doze.\u00a0Hooper was snarling and barking at the man.\u00a0\n \nThe man held his hand to his side with a sheepish look on his ugly face.\u00a0\u201cHey!\u00a0Yer mutt bit me! I oughtta tossit out the window, let the trees take it\u2026\u201d He started towards Hooper and the dog snapped at him, snarling and spraying spittle. \n \nTan whispered, \u201cgood dog,\u201d and held his leash close.\n \n \n \nIt wasn\u2019t until long after dark that Tan dared to let sleep take him.\u00a0The wretched man was asleep, the sounds of a thick trunked oak being sawed came from his way and Hooper was alert and watchful.\u00a0\nAs he drifted through a comforting tunnel towards dreamland, he found himself staring at the man. He was seeing through Hooper\u2019s eyes!\u00a0They blinked and he saw his family\u2019s house, then down the road to his neighbor\u2019s place, then on towards the church.\u00a0The vision spun suddenly, dizzyingly, towards the building next to it. The home where the parsonette cared for the orphans- it was on fire!\u00a0The church was smoking as well!\u00a0Hooper ran back to his family\u2019s home, flames leapt up the porch!\u00a0\n \nA man shape scuttled away, ragged, and filthy. Hooper jumped to the door but could not get in.\u00a0Fire sizzled his fur, a timber above cracked\u2026all went black.\n \nTan awoke with a gasp.\u00a0Hooper was still laying with his head on his paws, staring at the sleeping man across the aisle.\u00a0The grey on the man\u2019s face was soot.\u00a0The stink in his rags was his town, his home\u2026his family.\u00a0He glared with hatred at the sleeping figure the rest of the long dark morning.\n \n***\n \nThe sky at last lightened and to Tan\u2019s relief, was pink and turning blue.\u00a0The trees were normal and green\u2026the man was standing in the aisle stretching, then grabbing his heavy sack as the train began slowing to a stop.\n \nTan got up, not sure what he was going to do, but he couldn\u2019t let this murderer get away.\u00a0He would tell the sisters. He followed and Hooper followed.\u00a0\n \nThey exited the train after the man.\u00a0No one else got off at this station.\u00a0They were in the middle of a forest, not a town.\u00a0Hooper snarled and the man turned around.\u00a0Hooper lunged at his throat, tackling him to the ground.\u00a0\n \nTan screamed, \u201cYou killed my family!\u00a0You burned my town, my friends, my\u2026my\u2026\u201d he broke down and sobbed as Hooper tore at the sleeve that protected his throat. The man pulled a long thin dagger from his sleeve and sunk it between the dog\u2019s ribs.\u00a0Hooper screamed but would not let go\u2026until his life drained from him.\n \nThe man staggered to his feet and came after Tan.\n \nTan held his ground.\u00a0His dog was dead.\u00a0He had nothing left. He clenched his fists.\n \nA flash of white soared over them.\u00a0From the other side, a streak of shadow.\u00a0The man froze.\u00a0Then screamed as the two enormous wolves sank their teeth in, each grabbing an arm, as if fighting to win a wishbone pull.\u00a0They were the most beautiful creatures Tan had ever seen.\u00a0\n \nAfter dismembering the bad man, leaving his body in bloody lumps on the ground, they turned to Tan.\u00a0The nearly white one had eyes the color of a cloudy sky, the nearly black one had eyes the color of amber lit from inside.\u00a0They sat grinning as a woman came through the trees towards them.\n \nShe was dark-skinned, with almond shaped eyes, her hair was gold, red, and green with living strands.\u00a0She shimmered before the weeping Tan, who was cradling Hooper in his arms.\u00a0She wore the soft deerskin outfit of a hunter, with the long soft green cloak of a princess.\n \nShe came and stroked the two enormous wolves by their ears.\u00a0She said to Tan, \u201cI thank you, young friend, for your companion\u2019s fearless loyalty.\u201d Danika Windsong knelt, and her she-wolves lay down at her sides.\u00a0She took the limp dog in her arms and held him to her breast as Tan wept silently\u2026 \nThen gaped with wondrous joy as Hooper\u2019s eyes opened and his beloved doggy friend kissed his tears away."}
{"title": "Fear No Shadow", "story": " \nCurrently, Grumpkin didn\u2019t have lips, but if he did, he would have licked them. All he had was eyes, and they narrowed on the plump object in the room.\u00a0\n \n\u201cWhen\u2019s that blasted moon coming, I\u2019m tired of being so flat. I wanna sink my teeth into one of these toys.\u201d\u00a0\n \nPhlegmdrake rolled his yellow eyes. \u201cRemind me never to shadeskip with you again, you\u2019ve got the patience of a piranha.\u201d\n \nGrumpkin\u2019s red eyes burned, turning the shadows under the little bed crimson. \u201cI happen to be a very patient skipper, thank you very much. But look at all those treats. He\u2019s even got a plushie, think of how much cotton\u2019s in that. I can\u2019t wait to gobble it up.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow many times I gotta tell you, this ain\u2019t a gobbling job, this is a napp'n job. We ain\u2019t got time for cotton chewing.\u201d\n \nGrumpkin huffed, \u201cToynapping better pay well, all I gotta say, better pay real well. All this waiting around.\u201d\n \nPhlegmdrake\u2019s eyes squinted in a smile, \u201cIt does pay well\u2013something about this boy. Grimwicker said he\u2019d give us enough cotton to fill our tummies for months, if we can snatch the lion from him.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cGrumpkin\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cA \n lion?\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re a glutton, you know that. A gluttonous little shadeskipper. Yes, it\u2019s stuffed but \nyou can\u2019t eat him.\u201d Phlegmdrake cleared his throat in a bubbly cough. \u201cBesides, this one is different, he\u2019s stuffed with flaxseeds. Parents can warm it up or something.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cWarm it up? Seeds? Yuck, humans are so weird.\u201d\n \nPhlegmdrake opened his mouth to speak, but paused. A single beam of pale moonlight cut through the slatted blinds like a sword, lighting the far wall of the room in a gash of luminescence.\n \n\u201cThis is it,\u201d he said, \u201cnow\u2019s our chance.\u201d\n \nThe bed above them creaked with movement, and the shadeskippers froze.\n \nPhlegmdrake looked up, \u201cShh.\u201d\n \nThey looked to the wall. Two gashes of light striped the far side of the room, and then three. When the moon had drifted to the center of the window and shone through the blinds, illuminating the wall in a ladder of light, they made their move\u2013creeping out from under the bed slowly.\u00a0\n \nGrumpkin hesitated as he reached for the first wrung of the ladder, confirming that it was indeed moonlight, and not any of the poisonous alternatives, like sunlight, or streetlight.\u00a0 When his long black tendril latched on to the first step, the appendage grew out from the flat wall, the moonlight imbuing him with a third dimension. He continued to ascend, slowly, feeling his body fill the shadowed void that had replaced everything but his eyes. When he stepped away from the wall, he was in full figure, towering over the boy's bed with his red eyes and a host of serpentine limbs.\u00a0\n \nPhlegmdrake coughed as he climbed the moonlight, his whispered hacks becoming rounded and tonal, echoing in that three dimensional way. He smiled, it felt good not to be flat anymore. Shadeskipping had its perks, dashing between shade sources in the blink of an eye was fun\u2013being as silent as a whisper, efficient, but being whole again reminded him how much he wanted to be home, in Underbed, watching the moonset from his balcony.\u00a0\n \n\u201cWould you quit your hacking. Getting on my case for being a little hungry. I\u2019d rather be impatient, than loud. Now let's get this lion and get out of here.\u201d\n \nPhlegmdrake flashed a set of jagged teeth.\n \nGrumpkin shivered, feeling a momentary wave of vertigo. He found Phlegmdrakes huge mouth, and deep, dark, throat disturbing. \u201cWould you keep that thing shut, makes me feel like I\u2019m gonna fall in. Besides, your breath is going to wake the boy up. You smell like a coffin.\u201d\n \n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Phlegmdrake said, \u201cWho's calling the shots here?\u201d When he spoke the breath from his massive mouth swirled around the room, a paper drawing of a lion flapped against the wall, dangling from a thin piece of tape. The vibrations of his deep voice shook the walls of the room.\u00a0\n \nAs a shadow all he could do was whisper, but now his voice boomed when he spoke and he had to force the quiet into his words. \u201cJust grab the lion and get outta here.\u201d\u00a0\n \nThe two monsters stared down at the little lump of blankets covering the small boy.\u00a0\n \nGrumpkin spoke first, \u201cWhy do you think Grimwicker wants the boy\u2019s lion so badly? What\u2019s so special about it, or the boy?\u201d\n \n\u201cLook around,\u201d Phlegmdrake said, \u201cWhat\u2019s missing in this room?\u201d\n \nGrumpkin spun around and scanned the place. \u201cI dunno, nothing seems out of the ordinary for a kid his age.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t see no nightlight, do you?\u201d\u00a0\n \nGrumpkin looked again. He did not see a nightlight. \u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is,\u201d Phlegmdrake said, \u201cvery odd. This boy, apparently, is not afraid of the dark.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot afraid of the dark? Impossible.\u201d\n \n\u201cApparently it \n possible, and Grimwicker thinks the lion gives the boy courage. Take the boy\u2019s lion, and he\u2019ll fear us again.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n \nGrumpkin thought about this for a moment. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying the boy doesn\u2019t fear us because of that seed-stuffed toy?\u201d\n \n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Phlegmdrake tried to suppress a throaty cough. \u201cGrimwicker seems to think the boy is dangerous.\u201d\n \n\u201cDangerous?\u201d Grumpkin laughed, \u201cHim?\u201d\n \n\u201cGrimwicker thinks any child who isn\u2019t afraid of the dark could pose a threat to Underbed, even Closetton. Courage casts its own light, he told me, if it should fall on Underbed\u2026well, it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d\n \n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Grumpkin scoffed, jabbing a tentacle toward the blanket, \u201cThis is ridiculous, why don\u2019t we just wake the boy up, and show him what really lurks beneath his bed.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cNooo!\u201d Phlegmdrake yelled, but Grumpkin had already torn the covers away.\n \n\u201cWhat in the cellar furnace is that?\u201d Grumpkin said.\n \nBoth monsters cocked their heads trying to interpret the shape before them.\u00a0\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s not a kid, \u201c Phlegmdrake said, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2013it\u2019s, just a heap of stuffed animals.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cWrong, \u201c A young voice said behind them, \u201cThat right there, is a trap.\u201d\u00a0\n \nBefore the shadeskippers could react, the boy flipped a switch and light\u2013harsh, moonless, light\u2013 pierced them from every direction. Phlegmndrake roared and the room quaked. Books dropped from shelves. Papers and posters fell from the walls.\u00a0\n \nGrumpkin whipped a black tendril toward the boy, but a sharp beam of incandescent light blasted from a flashlight in the boy's hand and severed it in the air. The monster screamed and shrunk back. His flesh rippled and twitched. His tentacles writhed. And then he was flat again, a dark blotch against the wall\u2013two quivering eyes.\u00a0\n \nThen Phlegmdrake saw the boy snatch something away from the lense of his flashlight, a green, star-shaped object. His eyes widened; the star continued to glow even as the boy reared it up into the darkness above his head.\u00a0\n \n\u201cYou messed with the wrong kid, nobody touches my stuffed animals.\u201d Then he hurled the object. A blur of green soared toward Phlegmdrake\u2013too fast for him to dodge. When it struck the monster, it blasted him back against the wall, and he too, became a splash of shade.\u00a0\n \nWith tormented cries, two pairs of glowing eyes, red, and yellow, dashed back beneath the bed and disappeared into the world of darkness, returning to Underbed empty-handed, hurt, and humiliated by the boy who fears no shadows.\u00a0 \n "}
{"title": "Wet paint and gold lettering", "story": "Routine never fails to surprise. A peck on my soft cheek lays a wet parting gift as my mother trips out our brightly painted door. The sunshine yellow now starting to peel and twist into wrinkles at its edge, justifying our impulsive stroke of competence of suddenly knowing how to paint weathered hardware. A hand flies into the crack of the closing door as a last wave before escaping the jaws, snapping back into the doorframe. I stand once again in stillness, eyeing the two hands printed on the door face with craft paint signing our existence. My right hand still lingering with the sensation of red paint, foreign and heavy, bringing upon a compulsive need to touch everything around me so they too can feel such bliss.\u00a0\n\u2018Oh no darling come back here, don't drip it everywhere it will ruin the floors. Quickly while its still wet. Here, ready, give the door a high five with me\u2019. My mother guides my arm up, i place my hand on the fading print reaching its fingers just below my new ones. Releasing the connection, they both remain dry whilst my hand sits at my side wet, rubbing off the red paint onto my pants.\u00a0\n \nThe muffled world taunts and teases, whispering between themselves, occasionally singing out and knocking on the windows. The kitchen echos its light as it spills into the hall behind me, opening up the morning again with mother returning to the world at waking times, and finding use of the holidays by myself. Since turning ten, I can now view the various memories that play out on the walls at a comfortable level. Stationary until I provide the stories, the photographs speak and reach out, calling for more screen time as they encourage me to remember more.\u00a0\nA purple frame holds our family. The family that i do not see much of anymore. I stand and watch as the nuclear gathering of six, three generations shuffle in place guided by someone beyond the camera. The conductor steers them in place, so all of them are visible with an aesthetic nature that blesses the moment. Grandma watches in the centre, sitting below while the others scatter around. On her lap I sit restless, uncomfortable as her thin arms wire around me to attempt to settle me. Satisfaction slows everyone to a statue, my father and gorgeous mother, a distant cousin seen only once after then, aunty Jude holding grandma's shoulder. I hold thumbs up to the photograph and they all smile wide momentarily. The family drops back down their strung emotion after the click of the camera and everyone retreats to opposite ways. The baby is gifted off to the mother and the chair is left to sit forever stuck in the moment.\u00a0\nBelow in a smaller frame, one decorated with cheap flower embroidery, a puppy turns on its back, slapping its tail on the floor. Dry slobber mixes with fresh excitement as it fishes for attention with his dopey eyes. I see my reflection in the black beads, and am met with a yap that shakes me out of a lull.\u00a0\n\u2018Snoop!\u2019, i sing loudly to the dog. He jumps back to attention at his call. A lopsided grin as he yaps again sends me into a small giggle. I hop into a wave, matching his playful mood.\n\u2018Hey buddy! Hey, hi!\u2019, I find myself calling out in response to his barking as we jump around in circles, stopping and staring at each other before turning and running again. He runs under my feet, causing a quick jump out of his way, landing on my heels falling back into the wall behind me. My laughter catches in my throat as I'm winded from the surprise. Scrunching my face up in anticipation of being met with a tongue coating my pain with puppy breath, I stay dry and gasping for air.\u00a0\n\u2018Pup?\u2026\u2019. I open my eyes to no answer and\u00a0 watch the small flowery frame above me, holding a photo of the old houses worn and discoloured carpet, the fraying tassels being centre focus.\u00a0\n \nIn the kitchen I slip bread into the toaster and set the time to the line mother marked in sharpie to save any more tears over burnt toast. The butter sits next to the Nutella on the island table behind me, I move them over to my working space in front of me and grab my favourite plate and matching knife from the drying rack. With time to spare I do laps around the kitchen, counting how many I can get before the toast rings ready. No running because that is cheating, I mustn\u2019t stop because that will ruin it. The toast flags a total of Six and the small side of the table laps. I coat my breakfast in its clothes and sit at the front window table, only big enough for mother and I. The Nutella melted slightly on the toast sticks to my mouth as I bit into it, attempting to lick it off only resulted in more chocolate spread everywhere.\nA bin slams closed outside on the street and two ladies walk back to the centre of the path to continue on their way. Their legs march in time, bobbing their heads to the beat I'm giving them with my hand drumming the plastic table. Both wearing dresses like the ones I designed in my drawing book, only more layers of other different colours and shapes. Matching bags hang from their arms resembling those that presents are hidden in. Their destination must be a birthday party, a grand one that balloons hang from the doorframe of all different colours, with a big cake that has the special person's name iced on in gold lettering. The party must be so big, maybe there\u2019s room for everyone. I run back over to the countertop in the kitchen where mother puts the mail we get over the week. I shuffle through them and look for the fancy gold lettering, or maybe even a bright sticker that seals it all together. No luck.\u00a0\nI run back over to the window and look further down the street where they kept walking. Nearing the end of our road they pass the green pizza place with the extra cheese that sticks to the box. The neon light on the window flashing an unbelievable colour of pink shouts that it's open. In the window a man sits watching the street like me. The reflection of the world and its chaos slightly tinting my ability to see him properly. I mirror his position, placing my head in my hands, resting my elbows on the table. I shift in my seat to help myself get comfortable in the slumped posture but it still feels weird. I watch him while he watches the cars absently. I\u2019m sure it's the homework that has him wound up in such deep thought. The teachers always give the harder questions to you for your parents to deal with at home. It must be very advanced given his age but im sure he can figure it out, maybe i could go and give him my revision sheets from my recent multiplication test. It would have to be maths because of how hard he is thinking. He takes a bite of his pizza and is now looking down, maybe hes found the answer! Yes that must be it because he's up from the table now and has disappeared from the window. I blindly feel for my plate next to me and grab my breakfast. My toast is now cold.\u00a0\nI retreat back to my bedroom to finish the circus show that was parading around town, starring pooh the biggest bear to ever live, whilst the gymnast barbie shows the great lengths that her joints can be pushed to. The audience will have the collective favourite of the purple lizard that can jump through every shape imaginable.\u00a0\n \nThe light outside cools the house as the sun disappears behind the neighbouring buildings, casting a shadow through my window. Downstairs the news echos from the tv. The monotone voice, simplifying the world's chaos and mystery\u2019s, also alarms the time in which mother will return home. I run back downstairs.\u00a0\nThe world knocks again on our yellow door,\u00a0 shifting it open as it peeks in. Mother returns with a breath of fresh air. I pad over to the kitchen door to watch her peel off her shoes and place them facing towards her ready for tomorrow's adventures. Seeing me, she calls into a hug. Through the embrace I feel the movement of a sigh running from her body into mine, a habit I\u2019ve grown fond of, matching the rhythm of her breathing, struggling to keep up after the initial few rounds as my lung capacity forces me to gasp at a pace faster, breaking our unison. The moment is broken as her heel placed by the door falls from its statue form. A pat on the back serving a signal of content with the embrace and we head into the kitchen. My sticky feet slapping the furnished floors disturb the silence as mother glides in front of me with socks slightly faded at the heels. I take my place at the kitchen island as she unpacks various snacks left uneaten from her day bag. I smile at the slight rattle of the resin keychain attached to the front, alien in appearance to the formality of the bag. A rattle that matches the one that hangs from my school bag, resin now worn and tugged at, the cartoon picture now unrecognisable. I'm sure all her friends at work gather around in awe, holding out other colourful objects begging to trade, much like my friends do. I\u2019m sure she tells them its forbidden because it's a gift from me, much like I say to those who were now doubling the offers. The fridge door shuts and she moves over to flick on the lights that hang over us, given this warning i slightly shut my eyes waiting to open them to slowly adjust to the artificial lighting. She returns to the table and shuffles around cooking tools.\u00a0\n\u2018How was your day mum?\u2019, asking in a joyful tone to break the silence. She looks up to me and for a moment i felt there wasn\u2019t going to be an answer before breaking into a smile,\n\u2018work? Oh, it was wonderful!\u2026 I cant wait to wake up and do it all again tomorrow, and every time after that until I can no longer stand.\u2019\nWith that she returns to the carrots, cutting them into fine pieces, continuing on the conversation with a simple tone. Her voice echoing in our small apartment blocks out the world whispering and inviting itself to sneak in every crack and crevice of our house. Mother said her day was wonderful out in that big world, yet she still returns back to me. I cant wait to grow older and follow her ways of working. I will share the worlds mysteries amongst grand parties, homework with pizza, i will find the chair lost in the room and sit with my family, the puppy can sit on my lap, and I will whisper with the world too."}
{"title": "A Metaphor", "story": "\tLeaves wisp by in a crescendo, swirling and dancing through the cool evening air. Far removed from any city or town sits a train station. This is the station at the end of the line. Countless tracks lead into its terminals, and only one leads out. No one knows how to get there or even how they got there, but everyone ends up there. The platform is empty except for a small boy sitting on a bench accompanied only by the dancing leaves. He is counting the bricks, one by one, that are interwoven amongst the platform. The leaves whirl around his ankles and tickle his calves. The boy giggles and smiles with the sincerity that only an innocent child can espouse. No one is around to hear it, but it brings life to the deadness surrounding the train station. As if the leaves can understand him, the boy asks if they know when the next train will arrive. The leaves begin to waltz down the platform as if to invite the young boy to join in their dance.\n\tThe boy hops off the wooden bench with delight and hurries after the leaves as fast as his wee legs allow. He pitter-patters along, in awe of the train station, as if he is taking it in again for the first time. He jumps from brick to brick like a frog jumping between lilypads. The boy doesn't remember how long he has been at the station; it could be minutes, hours, days, or months. The boy is unbothered. He used to dread and worry about being left on the platform, but now he finds joy. The boy loves welcoming travelers from incoming trains. He guides them along the immaculate brickwork of the platform, up the stairs, and into the glowing lantern of the station before they are sent off on their final ride. Countless trains in and only one train out for the station at the end of the line. A distant whistle blares, and a plume of smoke can be seen far down the railway as a new train is about to enter the station.\n\tAs the train approaches, the station seems to come to life. The lights illuminate with a comforting glow like a hug from a lifelong friend. The station atop the steps begins revolving its doors, and a clock chimes from far away. The leaves become a vibrant pallet of autumn dancing about, creating a mosaic of fall colors. It is signaling an end and a beginning. The boy runs around, arms stretched wide, pretending to fly like an airplane as the train hums into the station letting out a final hiss to announce the end of its journey. The doors slide open like velvet curtains on a broadway stage, and the ticket masters emerge from every door in a synchronized fashion from the caboose to the engine. Dressed in red and black with shiny golden buttons glistening in the station lamps, they simultaneously check their pocket watches to confirm they are right on schedule. Then, one by one, passengers of all shapes and sizes, from people to pets, begin to exit the train. The pets are the boy's favorite part whenever he can sneak in a quick scratch behind a dog's ear or under a cat's chin. The boy waves and smiles at the passengers as they disembark from the train. The passengers reflect the boy\u2019s happiness as they all funnel towards the station with the revolving doors at the top of the steps. Without direction, the passengers all know where they need to go. In no rush, in an orderly fashion, they enter the station, tickets in hand, to take the final train to the stop at the end of the line. It is unclear to everyone how much time has passed since the train arrived, the passengers unloaded, and everyone entered the train station. The boy has returned to his seat on the wooden bench, swinging his feet into space as he awaits for one final passenger to exit the train.\n\tThe boy waits and watches patiently as the hands of the train station clock make another round. He's lost count of how many revolutions they have made. Like a spinning top that never falters, the hands pass from twelve to twelve. The boy is lost in hypnosis from the clock hands. The leaves stir at his feet again alerting him that the final passenger is emerging from the train.\n\tA woman timidly pokes her head out of the third car from the caboose. She is wearing a beige sweater, blue jeans, and white sneakers. She is in her mid-forties with auburn hair. Her deep brown eyes glisten in the train station\u2019s glow illuminating wisdom beyond her years. She looks from one end of the deserted platform to another, at a loss as to how she arrived here. The platform seems to extend indefinitely from either end as she gazes into the abyss expecting to see something that will never be there. Finally, her gaze meets that of a small boy swinging his legs beneath him on a wooden bench, waving her down and smiling at her. She senses an air of familiarity with this boy, although she doesn't recognize him. She takes a shaky breath, gives her ticket to the ticket master for the third car from the caboose, and puts one foot in front of the other to exit the train. As soon as she has left the train, the ticket masters return to their cars; the train exudes a final choo-choo and rolls back in the direction it came. Step by step, she approaches the young boy on the wooden bench with his swinging legs. She doesn't know what else to do and sits next to the boy on his wooden bench. The boy just sits and smiles, looking off into the distance.\u00a0\n\tThe woman finally speaks, \"Excuse me,\" her voice is shaky and uncertain, \"young man can you tell me where we are? I don't remember much besides waking up on an empty train car.\"\n\tThe boy chuckles as wholesome as a homemade loaf of bread and replies, \"There is always one, every train, there is always one, and it just so happens to be you. A person who feels resistant to the last stop of the line. That is okay though, you can take as much time as you need.\"\u00a0\n \n\t\"I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure I understand,\" said the woman. \"What do I need time for? What is this place? I don't think I can go back where I came from but I don't know where to go from here.\"\n\t\"Ahh,\" said the boy in a ponderous state, \"What you need time for, I cannot say; most people just disembark from that train, enter the station at the top of those stairs, and take the last train. As to where this place is, I am not exactly sure that is the right question to ask. The only way left for you to go is towards the station, in due time though, whenever you are ready. May I ask you something, how do I appear to you?\"\n\tThe woman looked more puzzled than before she had asked her questions. \"What do you mean how do you appear, don't you know what you look like young man?\"\n\tThe boy smiles again, \"Yes and no, I appear however you need me to appear. I have been many things: a man, a woman, a young girl, a dog, and a cat. But I am always here for those who need a little more time, right here, upon this bench amongst the dancing leaves. Do I look familiar to you? Any names or thoughts come to mind?\"\n\tThe woman has more questions than answers but is reconciling, calming, and relaxing. \"You do look familiar like someone who may have been but never actually was. I feel like I need to walk up those steps but I don't know what will happen after and it frightens yet also excites me a little. I wish I had answers to more of my questions. Would you happen to know what I may be asking young man? Also, may I call you something, is Garth an okay name for you?\"\n\t\"Certainly, Garth works just fine, miss,\" The boy responded with an endearing smile that only a child can give. As to your questions, those are a tad tricky to answer. No one knows what happens, where you go, or what becomes of you.\" The boy gave another laugh. \"That is where the excitement and fright come hand in hand, I am afraid. You can no longer board the train you just departed from you, even if it did come back. But, there is one more train through that station that can take you wherever you are meant to go. I know it is scary, and it goes to the end of this line, but who's to say there isn't more at the end destination or even if there is an end destination? It could be a ride to oblivion, a ride back to the beginning, or anything in between. I can't give you the answers because I don't know them, and no one ever will, probably. Those answers await you and only you whenever you feel the time is right.\" Garth jumped from the bench and extended a hand, \"I can walk with you up the steps to the station if you like?\"\n\tThe woman didn't understand what was happening, but she knew it didn't matter. The time she needed had passed, and she felt resolved about entering the station. She stood and grabbed Garth's hand with a smile that he returned in earnest. They both took one step after another up the stairs to the station. They could have climbed those stairs for a minute or years, but it didn't matter anymore. The woman and Garth were approaching the revolving doors. They heard a distant yet familiar train whistle somewhere on the other side.\n\t\"Sounds like your train is here, miss.\" Garth asked, \"Anything else I can do for you before we part ways?\"\n\tThe woman wavered and thought, pondering as she began to enter the revolving doors. \"Are you sure you don't know where we are and what this is, Garth?\"\n\t\"Still a bit hung up on unanswerable questions, I see.\" Garth chuckled and responded, \"This is nothing more than a metaphor, miss. As to where we are, I think it is quite obvious, we are at a train station.\"\n "}
{"title": "The fairytale book", "story": "The pages from the book were pressing hard on me from above and made it difficult to breathe. I did not know how much time had passed. Perhaps a week since Dan picked the book up to read. Or a month. Or a whole year. When no one reads the story you are in for a long time, the sense of time disappears. Sometimes slow steps came from the room. Dan\u2019s grandmother would enter the room to dust off the shelves or to watch the TV. She\u2019d sit there quietly with the lowest volume set on the TV so that she could hear the rest of the family come home. Then she\u2019d join them in the kitchen and it would become too quiet again. Being alone in the room was even more daunting then being alone in a book.\nThe book was a children\u2019s fairytale. On the page seven lived tigers. They wouldn\u2019t eat me or kill me. But they could leave bad scratches or bites which would hurt for a long time. The tigers prevented me from seeing my friends. All of them lived on the other side from the tigers. My closest friend, The Talking Tower lived on page twelve. She was very hard to be around as she was 600-years old and would judge everything and everyone around. But now I found talking to her was better than talking to myself in my mind. Having pondered about my decision I chose to risk and to visit the Talking Tower. Quietly I turned over the page and went to the next one. Then I skipped several pages. There were just pictures that were supposed to look like us but none of them did. They drew me as a yellow pony with a brown tail when in reality my tail was pinkish. The writer created me this way. But forgot to mention it in the book, so here I went. The characters saw my pinkish tail, but the readers would assume it was brown. Or they just didn\u2019t pay attention to small things like that.\nThe family of the rabbits were wearing t-shirts and shorts in the picture. But they never wore any clothes as it was always too hot in their house. None of the pictures looked like the reality and I hurried to get to the Talking Tower. luckily, the tigers were taking a nap and I walked passed them unnoticed.\n-don\u2019t start yelling. I know you are bored and old and want to nag at everyone around-said I.\nBut the Tower didn\u2019t respond. I stepped closer to her and looked up. She looked sad and the window-sills which were supposed to be her eyebrows were crooked downwards.\n-what\u2019s wrong? -I started getting worried.\n-I feel that I don\u2019t have much Left-It was unsettling to hear her usually loud voice be so weak.\n-there are towers that are much older than you, I heard of a tower who is 1200 years\u2019 old\n-you do forget basic things.\n-what?\n-we are book characters, and we are immortal\u2026\n-then why are you saying\u2026-started I, but she interrupted me.\n-\u2026as long as someone reads us and remembers. -finished the Tower.\nSuddenly I regretted coming here. Not knowing the sad truth would be easier. Characters would disappear one by one and the pages would turn white. Even the tigers would disappear. Then I would be the last one to disappear too, as the story begins with me. What will I do when everything I knew since the beginning ends and I am left alone? What will happen to me after I disappear? Will it be a death like humans\u2019 experience or will I just forget everything and wake up as a new character in a different story? Since we are fictional, will we go to fictional hell and heaven?\nMy very first memory was still with me. I was invisible for a few minutes. The writer was creating me in front of me. I still can\u2019t remember what she looked like. But she wore thick glasses and had very curly hair. Suddenly I grew four dog legs and large years.\n-Ok, you\u2019ll be a dog\u2026came a voice. I looked at the writer, but she wasn\u2019t speaking. Apparently, those were her thoughts.\n-nooo-yelled I. Make me a nice pony, I want to gallop through the book.\nI didn\u2019t hear myself, but she suddenly stopped typing. Then took off her glasses, wiped them and put them back on again.\nI saw my paws turn into a pony legs and laughed.\n-and I want a pink tail. Make my tail pink-asked I.\nNot now, stop bothering me or I\u2019ll forget the names of the Rabbits' Family. \n-stop thinking so hard -the Talking Tower seemed irritated. -and look behind me.\nBehind the Talking Tower there was nothing. Just white emptiness. Everyone else disappeared and now me, The Tower, and the tigers were the only ones left.\n-we have to make someone read the book! -screamed I.\n-they forgot about us. All the kids do nowadays is just play on their stupid\u2026 what are they called? Temefoles?-the Tower seemed to get her bad temper back.\n-not now! I have a plan.\nLuckily, the Tower was big and heavy enough. If she managed to shake the book and make it drop, someone from the family would eventually remember and read it.\nI ran to the side of the page and pushed hard to make the book fall. It took some time, but we succeeded and it fell with a loud thud. The tower hit me when we were falling and hurt my leg but I forgot about the pain as soon as I heard the steps running to the noise.\n-oh wow! Your book fell, Dan-came the Mom\u2019s voice. I\u2019ll read it to you tonight before bed.\nWe let out the biggest cheers but of course no one heard us.\nLater that evening, the Mom opened the first page. She saw the black text on the white page and started reading out loud, making the list of groceries she needs to buy tomorrow in her mind at the same time. But her son immediately saw me and cheered. I jumped from the joy. His mom turned the page and continued reading as Dan watched me gallop through the book to meet the tigers, the Talking Tower, and the Rabbits\u2019 family."}

How can I hold myself high with confidence when the weight of a decision is pulling me down?\nI cannot choose to throw away what is good. But am I even choosing to throw it away? Or am I preserving it?\nWe are given opportunities to change and with those opportunities, it almost always seems that the chances are to be hoped for, but what if the opportunity is good enough that it can make it bad? I am faced with that: the good worst choice.\nIf I have to make my future, I should make it a fulfilled and steadfast one.\nIf I have to let fate make my future, I should live it freely.\nIf I choose to believe I am preserving some parts of my future life, then the answer is clear: I can do what is surely good. The good that is reliable, that isn't settling. I can always have new interests and therefore new options, this might be even better than what I am narrowing my vision to right now.\nI can choose, as long as I have support.

These \"others\" are the ones who support their \n of me leaving this platform, meaning they support the life I have. I am grateful for both, but doesn't it seem a little obvious what the answer should be? To take the risk to live a life outside of what is already known? To not be stuck, right?\nTo be stuck, just for a little while, could further the height I could jump in this \nBut what am I missing, what am I not living?\nThe dream I am pursuing is a dream to everyone outside of my head, but it is a reality to my conscientious carefree, independent mind. Why should I let that go... when I am given chance?\nI am still standing. Only a couple of breaths have gone by, unlike the dozens of the established decisions that the people have while passing me by. They walk with their disposition to the platform. They move with the procedure. But I saw that some did not. Some hesitate. But not like me. I am stuck. They have come here already knowing, even if they want to say they were unsure. I am stagnant. Unable to help myself.\nThis hurts to decide. It might hurt me to fail. It might hurt others for thinking that they should save me from failing. Why should it be their burden that in turn becomes mine? Why should I feel the anxiousness of their anxiety?\nI could go, it doesn't matter where. I could physically be right next door, but it would still be a change. Would they still feel as anxious? I know they would. (Is this me feeling trapped?). Or is that still just my presumption? I could avoid those who I live with on a regular basis and not too many words are spoken about how they want to see me. But, suddenly if I were to still not be physically in front of them, it only becomes a problem when there can be no immediate return for them. If I couldn't come back with just a casual invitation. Them saying, \"When you come home, grab some groceries.\" That sentence will no longer be their reality. They can't. Is this what scares them? I know to a degree it's what I want. I want to be cared for without the obligations of a short distance. Is this selfish of me?\nIt's like Schrodinger's cat. They don't know what they don't see. And that scares them... but it doesn't when I am in a certain radius? How could I relieve them of this? I don't think I can. How can I accommodate the feelings of everyone? Can I? I could try. Should I?\nStill frozen in thought, this is still what is racing through my mind. One decision fighting the other to the finish line. But remember... this is a timed race.

I could hear and feel and taste what they have not. I want to go!\n...\nBut... If I leave, even for a short while, I might be missing what I have right in front of me. I would miss the education which could take me places even higher. I would miss the people around me experiencing new things. I would be excluding them from my life, even for that short while. What if a man I am supposed to marry is only a city away from home but I missed the chance to meet him? What if I miss the opportunities to deeply route myself into the culture around me?\n...\nBut... what if I meet that man while I am away? Would I find the different cultures which accepted me deeply?

This is when the monster comes Every night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, that creepy loud click; then the dark inky shadows creep closer and closer to his bed.\u00a0\u00a0He jerked his soft blue flannel blanket over his head and squeezes his eyes tightly shut.\n\u2018\nPeyton quietly told himself as he repeats what his mommy and daddy told him the night before. And he did believe them, he really did! It was just so hard to remember mommy\u2019s brave words when that door, that huge dark heavy door, closed, Peyton frustratedly thought to himself.\u00a0\nHe slowly lowered his blanket, which was currently also his impenetrable shield, so that his round deep brown eyes could peer into the solid darkness of the room. As his eyes slowly adjust , he watched the prismatic red, blue and green light shadows, from his cool new Halloween strobe light, dance across his walls. It was mommy\u2019s idea to help him be a big boy and sleep in his own room at night. But he didn\u2019t have too, he reminded himself emphatically.\u00a0\u00a0if it is ever so scary that he can\u2019t take it , then mommy said he can come in her room.\u00a0\n, he thought stubbornly to himself, as he let his small lower lip pout slightly.\u00a0\u00a0Even if daddy was a big meanie and said \u2018\nPeyton mimicked as he scrunched his small face.\u00a0\u00a0\n, he proudly thought as he contemplated if he should head to mommy\u2019s room.\u00a0\n!\n, he thought as a small shiver ran down his spine.\u00a0\u00a0He slowly lowered his protective blanket past the waist of his soft cotton Spider-Man pajamas and wiggled onto his belly to peer over the edge of his full sized bed, his soft brown curls tumbling onto\u00a0\u00a0his forehead as his head hung over the edge.\n\u2018\n\u00a0.\u2019 Peyton whispers as he tentatively lowered his small feet to the ground then paused cautiously to take another calculated look at his gigantic bedroom. The kaleidoscope of colors continue to make slow methodical circles around the room occasionally reflecting off the random shiny toy left on his floor. Then he saw it! The answer to his problem;\u00a0\n! He squeals to himself!\u00a0\u00a0It would protect him till he could make it to his mommies room. But he had to get to his Spider-Man and it is sitting next to his dresser across his room.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2018\n\u2018 Peyton groans as he realizes this monumental feat. This is going to require him to get onto the floor AND get to the dresser to get spidey BEFORE the stupid monster got his foot! It just wasn\u2019t fair. Why wouldn\u2019t mommy just leave the door open and the light on.\u00a0\n\u2018\n\u2019 Peyton mimics as he remembers what his mommy told him before she closed that huge door .\u00a0\nPeyton glanced again at the lone Spider-Man toy and began to plan the safest path to the doll.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeyton quietly instructs himself as he lets the kaleidoscope light illuminate his path, \u2018\n\u00a0Peyton announces in an exciting whisper.\u00a0\n\u2018\n\u00a0Peyton grins to himself as he delicately begins tippy toeing the first part of his perilous journey. Another small shiver works its way down his narrow shoulder\u2019s as the chill from the hardwood floors began seeping into his small bare feet.\u00a0\n\u2018\n.\u2019 He exclaims as spideys soft red and blue fabric attire draws nearer.\u00a0\u00a0His small fingers swiftly secure the doll\u2019s soft fabric arm and clutches the toy to his chest with a sign of relief.\n\u2018\nPeyton whispers as he begins tippy toeing towards his basket of nerf guns.\n\u2018\nPeyton meticulously counted the way him and daddy practiced earlier.\u00a0\n\u2018\nPeyton celebrates as his body performs his fortnight dance with fluent ease, ending with an elaborate \u2018dab\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0His small face crumbles into a fit of giggles as his slight frame doubled over in laughter.\nOnce composing himself, And feeling quite confident since making it this far successfully, Peyton proceeded to gently place one foot solidly on top of his basket of guns followed by the next foot; each gingerly progressing him to his destination, the door. One hand firmly pressed against the wall and the other hand perilously clutches Spider-Man\u2019s arm as his feet inch forward.\u00a0\nSuddenly there is a low whining groan followed by the collapse of the nerf gun pile.\u00a0\u00a0A startled gasp barely escapes his mouth before Peyton tumbles off the top of the nerf guns and lands sprawling out on his hardwood floor. Every muscle in his tiny body froze as he realizes where he is and how perilous his situation was.\nPeyton assesses as his tiny hand feels along the grooved wooden floor to find his toy. Once he felt the reassuring soft fabric of Spider-Man\u2019s arm, he looks around to see what his next move is. As his curious brown eyes look around, he discovers that his situation has gotten worse.\n\u2018\nPeyton whispers in horror as he looks at his right bare foot that is millimeters from black spikey hair poking out from under the bed.\u00a0\n\u2018\nPeyton screams as he channels his inner sonic the hedgehog and races to his mommy\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0\u00a0With one swift turn of the cold brass knob, a strategic jump into mommy and daddy\u2019s huge king size bed and heavy sigh of relief; he is finally safe.\n\u2018\nPeyton smiles to himself as he cuddles into his mommy\u2019s warm soft back.\n\u2018\nDaddy says in that unpropitious tone that Peyton dreads.\u00a0\n\u2018\nPeyton passionately explains.\n\u2018\nDaddy logically decides\u00a0\n\u2018\nPeyton groans emphatically as Daddy lets him climb onto his back for a piggy back ride to Peyton\u2019s room.\u00a0\n\u2018\nDaddy asks sympathetically.\n\u2018\u00a0\nPeyton answers matter of factly.\n\u2018\n\u2019 Daddy encourages softly as he turn the smooth brass knob and flicks on the light illuminating all of Peyton\u2019s superhero wall decor; Spider-Man posters, Hulk figurines, Captain America plaques , sonic the hedgehog fat head poster; all of Peyton\u2019s favorite heroes.\u00a0\n\u2018\n\u00a0Daddy reassures as he ruffles Peyton\u2019s soft curly hair.\nthe pair both squat down to their hands and knees and peer expectantly under Peyton\u2019s bed.\n\u2018\nPeyton stoically nodded as he firmly grips Daddy\u2019s warm hand.\n\u2018\nDaddy warmly confirms as they both lower their heads and discover the monster under the bed.\n\u2018\neyton squeals as he burst into uncontrollable giggles."}
{"title": "The Visit", "story": "The candle on the bedside table flickered briefly. Afraid of the dark since a small child, I could not find the solace of sleep without the security of light. \n\t\u2018Oh no, please do not go out!\u2019 I pleaded terrified of waking alone and defenceless in darkness. I sat up in bed to check if the candle needed replacing. It did not. Only half consumed, its flame burned steadily as if recognizing how much I needed its comfort. \n\t\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I breathed. Neck muscles relaxed as relief flooded through me. I watched the candle flame grow brighter mesmerising me. I shook my head to escape its power and as I did so on the wall behind the bedside table, a shadow crept up from the floor spreading like an evil genie as it reached the top of the wall angling across the ceiling until it loomed over me. Blinking to clear my eyes of the fog of sleep. The room temperature suddenly dropped. Shivering uncontrollably from cold or dread, the hair on the back of my neck bristled as I tried to reconcile reality and logic with fantasy and fear. Puzzled I asked myself \n\t\u2018How can this be? There is nothing behind the candle flame to cast such a shadow! And it cannot be mine even though in my current state of alarm I might be afraid of it.\u2019\n\tToo terrified to turn round, I shut my eyes tightly, listening intently for the slightest sound which might betray a presence in the room which remained as silent as a windless desert or a Pharoah\u2019s undiscovered tomb. I opened my eyes to see the shadow change shape from a looming genie to a crouching succubus come to seduce and drain me of my bodily fluids. Soft breath blew on my ear making my body quiver. Fingers feather soft stroked my chest tracing their way towards my lower body. Unable to resist I turned to face my phantom lover.\n\tInstead of a beautiful ethereal woman, a handsome man sat on the bed looking down at me. Striking in a military officer kind of way, dressed in a smart blazer with shiny gold buttons, a striped regimental tie and white shirt. His sandy hair greying at the temples cut short above his ears gave him a distinguished look. Well groomed and attractive in a George Clooney kind of way. \n\t\u2018I come in many forms,\u201d it said, blue eyes bright.\n\tIts left eye grew larger as if under a magnifying glass and zoomed in on mine. I could see a large bird like an eagle or a vulture flapping towards me from the center of this eye\u2019s pupil appearing to get larger but only because it was dragging me inexorably into its depths. I did not have strength to fight against it as relentlessly it my soul consumed. Transfixed, hopeless and helpless in its thrall, it dragged me to the abyss and an endless fall. A silent scream of terror choked my throat. My body levitated from the bed, hovered like a hunting kestrel, plunged down and bounced back up again to float for two seconds before tumbling down again filling me with dread. Each bounce lifted me like a tiny boat beneath a surging tsunami. Ahead and over, waiting to pitchfork to hell swamped by a mountainous, steepling swell.\n\tThen a black void swallowed me whole like a shark devouring a hapless, miniscule fish. My body hurtled from day into dark arms locked against ears, sensing the slick swish of clothes swirling and thrashing through slippery seaweed as stark dread compelled me to make a death wish pulse racing, nostrils flared, eyes screwed tight shut, bowels loosened by the fear in my gut. I plunged for what seemed a lifetime before I blacked out. Beyond caring as if dead to the core deprived of feelings like a mindless lout destroys for fun or swept ashore like surfers shattered in a last wipe-out. \n\tAwakening in pitch blackness, I found myself in a cavern standing in a silence profound. Nothing stirred in the stillness of that place. A strange smell suffused the air like the incense used in a great cathedral to replace the smell of the poor to give no offence to God in prayers and in case the scented rich complained. Still in suspense, I stretched out a trembling hand to feel my way hoping for that which might allay my fears. Nothing. Darkness wrapped round me like a shroud. \n\t\u2018Am I blind?\u2019 I asked myself as my appeals for help echoed mockingly in emptiness.\n\tMy pleas decreased in volume as hope evaporated and the walls of the cavern closed in tight around me. Clarity returned and rational thought allowed logic to replace fear. Devoid of panic, I assessed my situation: was I trapped between heaven and hell, in limbo, or the bottom of a well? Looking up, I glimpsed a circle of light as though through the wrong end of a telescope. Stars flickered there sometimes dim, oft times bright. Obviously, I wasn\u2019t dead nor devoid of hope because I could breathe and possessed good sight. But how to reach those stars without a rope or means of climbing up to them? If in limbo, I would be powerless to escape but if I were at the bottom of a dry well or bottle dungeon an exit might be possible if I could conceive of a way to do it.\n\t\u2018If a well, it might be made of bricks to offer foot or toe holds to climb up on.\u2019\n\tReaching out I felt not brick but a smooth surface of concrete. Tracking round a circular wall my hands encountered a metal ladder bolted into it. I tentatively place one foot on the first rung followed by the other. which proved to hold my weight. Just as I reached the top of the ladder a heavy access hole cover crashed down sealing the exit and narrowly missing my fingers. I lost my balance and fell backwards into the void once more but this time swept inexorably to the edge of a horrifying waterfall and tumbling helplessly like a rag in a washing machine plummeting down and landing on my bed which had turned into a terrifying trampoline. Tossed and thrown, all seemed lost until a small quiet voice whispered in my ear, \n\t\u201cSay the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u201d\nwhich in my naive youth I might have rejoiced to do but in aged disbelief I did not dare. God forgive me, there was no other choice. But I could not remember the words I swear until they seemed emblazoned on my brow. I recited them more in hope than in belief. Straightway the hideous bouncing lessened and the words vanquished the terror, I know not how, until I lay at peace and slept like a new-born baby.\n "}
{"title": "Fanfare", "story": "What first hit me was the cold. What I first hit was the printer. Daft to leave the tray poking out over the bin everyone was discarding their cupcake cases in. \n \nThere were fans on every desk. As well as overhead fans. The flapping of neon post-it notes forming the disco lights of the party. All the windows were wide open, the sounds of gulls and sirens added to the mix of the whirring of the blades and the hens\u2019 clucking going into overdrive as they welcomed me, the new chick.

I had wanted to add a little height to my 5\u2019 1\u201d frame. Instead I looked like a slut with a hobble. That\u2019s the last time I rely on the fashion pages of Cosmopolitan magazine. \n \nEnforced fun. The worst kind. I just wanted to get back to my desk. I needed to get in touch with IT to sort out their mistake when they were setting me up with an email address. It\u2019s \u2018J-O-D-I-E\u2019, not \u2018J-O-D-Y\u2019. Not like I had to send them a million forms with my name spelled as it should be beforehand or anything. Maybe it\u2019s their idea of fun, when they\u2019re not spying through the webcams. \n \nSomeone whose name was Sally or Sarah is exclaiming over my nose ring. \u201cDoes it hurt? What happens when ya hafta blow yer nose??\u201d You could just hear the double question mark. I was used to it from men on dating apps following up from messages they\u2019d sent milliseconds ago, less so from women I was meeting for the first time in a professional setting. I could tell Sally-or-Sarah was just itching to touch the ring. I\u2019d been warned of the Gollums from accounts by a friend who\u2019d just left the Trust. I managed to slip away after distracting her by pointing out the dollop of coleslaw adorning her cardigan. \n \nSomeone it took me a month to figure out was called \u2018Cee-Cee\u2019, not \u2018Sissy\u2019, was fanning herself (\u201cthe hot flushes, they\u2019re non-stop \u2013 never get old, m\u2019lovely!\u201d) with a patient information leaflet on eating disorders while simultaneously demanding I pile my floppy paper plate high from a beige wobbling pyramid of sausage rolls. On closer inspection of the buffet table I was surprised to find their vegan counterparts. I suppose not having a plant-based option would result in human rights violation emails to HR from the girl I spied with the too short fringe. The shorter the fringe, the shorter the temper, so I\u2019ve found. I\u2019d be annoyed too if I had been given that haircut. I think because we\u2019re similar in ages I\u2019m expected to gravitate towards her but I\u2019d rather be alone with the homemade samosas I\u2019d just spotted. \n \nI was about to pocket a handful of After Eights so I could have them later at the designated time the brand creators had in mind but then became ensnared as soon as my fingertips brushed the little square envelopes. I had to pretend to listen to a rare fox among the hens superciliously drone on about the apprenticeship in Information Governance he co-ran. I told him I\u2019d like to at least complete my mandatory training first \u2013 unfortunately he took that to be a joke, guffawing and spraying cheesy biscuit crumbs. He actually gave me a business card when he got a hold of himself again, as though I couldn\u2019t just look him up on the intranet. I caught a couple of the hens twinkling beady eyes at each other. Sorry to disappoint, Sally-or-Sarah and Ann-or-Anita, this isn\u2019t the start of some office romance. This is the start of me collecting evidence to tell the Green Team how trees were being killed so Andrew could enjoy the feeling of shoving his face in my palm, given he wouldn\u2019t be shoving it anywhere else on me anytime soon. \n \nAt least three of the phones are ringing, but nobody is answering. Not when there are snacks.\n \nI muffled a sigh. I was there to work. I was there to change things. From the inside. I had experienced all the failings of the healthcare system as a patient, what with years of misdiagnoses since a young girl. The blackouts that were put down to puberty, hormones, not enough exercise, not enough vitamin C in my diet. The mood swings. The constant pain. Being asked all the time and always by a new consultant, never the one I\u2019d seen last, if I was taking recreational drugs. I was angry. But I was ready. I\u2019d get through this dreary do, fix the fuck up with my name, then I would start to help those in need. Because I knew the wilderness of being knocked off the waiting list for unclear reasons. I knew-\n \nA proffered miniature plastic cup of warm orange juice snaps me out of my reverie. The strip lights (the cause of so many of Maureen\u2019s migraines, lest we forget) shimmer and dance on the surface of the liquid, drawing me forwards. I dive in. So sweet. \n \nA nervous new girl places a lilac coloured envelope on the corner of my desk where I\u2019ll read thirty of the same platitudes scrawled inside, or at least try to while the flies and the phones buzz around my decaying carcass, before it goes straight into the recycling bin when I get home: \n \n\u201cHappy retirement Jody!\u201d\n \nNever get old.\u00a0"}
{"title": "Good Luck", "story": "One day while walking through the streets with her skateboard in hand and punk rock playing in her headphones, fourteen year old Kate saw a cat. A black cat with blue eyes. Kate had hyperfixated on and studied cats and knew that it was uncommon for a black cat to have blue eyes. She crouched down and put her hand out. The cat looked at her hand and noticed the small crystal in it. The cat approached closer and took the crystal into his mouth. The cat looked into Kate\u2019s deep brown eyes and nudged her hand. Kate pet the cat\u2019s head and kissed his head. She picked up the cat and held him in her arms. Kate stared at the cat and thought of a name, \u201cMochi\u201d she said aloud. She placed the cat into her sack and started skating home. Mochi sat contently playing with the crystals in her bag. When she got home she yelled, \u201cMom i\u2019m home!\u201d and continued to her room in the basement. Not to her surprise when she got into her room she was greeted by her boyfriend sitting on her bed, reading. \u201cHi Quinn look what I found.\u201d She let Mochi out of her bag and onto her bed. Mochi approached Quinn slowly to sniff his feet. \u201cMochi thinks you have stinky feet.\u201d Kate chuckled. Quinn\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cMochi? That\u2019s such a cute name! You\u2019re the best girlfriend ever.\u201d and he pulled Kate onto the bed and held her in his arms. Kate sighed and wished Mochi and Quinn could stay here forever. She knew sooner or later Mochi would be sent outside again. She held Mochi tight while Quinn kissed her cheeks and neck. She giggled, \u201cQuinn stop! I need you to take care of Mochi.\u201d Quinn stopped and let go of her. \u201cTake care of Mochi? Are you sure? You just found him.\u201d Kate raised her eyebrow surprised that her boyfriend would doubt Kate\u2019s ability to take care of them both. \u201cPlease Quinn\u201d She said while flashing her puppy dog eyes. \u201cAlright fine but only because I love you\u201d He turned to Mochi and booped his nose, \u201cand you too.\u201d Kate stood up abruptly and kissed Quinn\u2019s forehead. \u201cWant to go to the store?\u201d Kate asked and Quinn nodded and got off Kate\u2019s bed. \u201cLet\u2019s blast.\u201d said Quinn and he put his shoes on and grabbed Mochi. Kate grabbed her skate board and hopped on. She handed Quinn his skateboard and started skating. \u201cKate! How do I hold Mochi while skating?\u201d Kate turned around and said \u201cSorry! Let me grab him so I can put him in my bag.\u201d When Kate and Quinn arrived at the pet store the door rung when she walked in and set Mochi on the ground. Quinn started looking at clothes for cats and Kate pulled him over to the food bowls. \u201cWhich ones do you want?\u201d She asked as Quinn browsed the selection. \u201cI like this one.\u201d He said while pointing to a bowl with cat ears. \u201cCute!\u201d Kate said and grabbed one for water and one for food. \u201cDo you think he needs a collar?\u201d Quinn asked but instead of Kate responding Mochi responded with a mow. \u201cSounds like he does.\u201d Kate said. Kate proceeded to grab a crystal out of her bag to give to Mochi but he refused it. \u201cAww c\u2019mon Mochi I need you to hold this for me.\u201d He hissed and walked away. \u201cThat was weird.\u201d Quinn said while holding a costume for Mochi. \u201cQuinn! He might be able to sense good crystals from bad!\u201d Kate whispered making sure Mochi couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cWow that\u2019s bold of you to assume, Kate.\u201d Quinn teased. Kate scowled and blushed, \u201cI dunno. It seems odd that he has blue eyes.\u201d Kate continued. Quinn listened but decided to change the topic. \u201cWhere \n Mochi?\u201d Quinn asked and left the aisle. Kate followed while calling Mochi\u2019s name, \u201cMochi! Mochi!\u201d Quinn appear holding Mochi. \u201cGot him\u201d He said triumphantly. Kate kissed both of them on their heads and proceeded to checkout. \u201cA collar, bowls for food and water, cat food, cat bed, cat toy\u201d The cashier said while putting the things into a bag. Quinn looked at Kate and she grinned. \u201cHey can I stay at your house tonight?\u201d Quinn asked. Taken off guard and blushing Kate replied, \u201cOh uh sure, you can stay in my room\u201d Quinn grinned and kissed Kate\u2019s cheek. \u201cThanks, love.\u201d Kate loved it when Quinn called her love.\u00a0\nKate and Quinn stopped by a Vietnamese restaurant and fed Mochi some rice. \u201cI think he likes it!\u201d Kate said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s Filipino like me\u201d Quinn grinned like a proud father. The wind was strong outside and it blew the door to the cafe open. Kate jumped to sit closer to Quinn. \u201cHaha! Did that scare you?\u201d Quinn asked while rubbing Kate\u2019s hands. \u201cJust a bit. I guess i\u2019m superstitious right now\u201d Kate sighed. \u201cSuperstitious? Kate? No. Never.\u201d Quinn said sarcastically. \u201cQuinn I\u2019m serious I think something might be going on with-\u201d Kate glanced at Mochi, \u201c\n\u00a0Quinn laughed and said \u201cYea I know but just because he turned around when he sniffed one of your crystals doesn\u2019t mean he can tell what the energy is like.\u201d Kate sighed and gave up, \u201cYou\u2019re right I was paranoid.\u201d Quinn picked up some noodles with chopsticks and put them into his mouth. The cafe had cleared of people and it was just them. Mochi slept on Quinn's backpack with the amethyst attached to his collar. Quinn put his arm around Kate will she stared at her food. \u201cC\u2019mon Kaitibug, will you give me a tarot reading later?\u201d Kate grunted in agreement and continued to eat. When Kate and Quinn got home they snuck downstairs into Kate\u2019s room. Kate changed into pajamas and gave Quinn her extra pair. Quinn buried his feet into Kate\u2019s rug and pet Mochi on his soft head. Kate laid down while Quinn stayed sitting up. The red LED lights made it hard for Quinn to read his book so he laid his head down next to Kate\u2019s. Mochi crawled over the two and found a spot in the corner of the bed. Kate rested her head onto Quinn\u2019s chest and thought about what to do with Mochi. She decided that Mochi could stay with her but he would need to come to school with her. Quinn ran his fingers through Kate\u2019s hair. \u201cYou know, I believe you there might be something sketchy with Mochi. I mean how is he asleep? He could be cuddling with the cutest girl ever.\u201d Kate moved her legs to be on top of Quinn's. \u201cMeh I think there\u2019s something actually up with him.\u201d Kate mumbled. \u201cYou can tell me all about it tomorrow\u201d Quinn said and Kate quickly fell asleep.\nIn the morning Kate woke up sick. With a cold to be specific. Her nose turned a bright crimson red and and her eyes were puffy. Not only could Kate barely breathe through her nose but she also could hardly see. Quinn was still fast asleep in Kate\u2019s bed when she left to tell her mom that she couldn\u2019t go to school. Her mom told her to make some tea and get some rest. Kate went down into her room to see Quinn crying. \u201cQuinn! What\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Kate exclaimed. Through tears Quinn explained, \u201cOver half of your crystals have been chewed up by Mochi!\u201d \n Kate thought to herself but sure enough they had been destroyed. She looked at the broken crystals and saw that the same crystal that Mochi had turned away was in that pile. \u201cQuinn i\u2019m going back to bed\u2026are you going to school today?\u201d Quinn shook his head and sat up in the bed. Mochi appeared from out of the closet. \u201cHmmm, there\u2019s the crystal killer himself.\u201d Mochi meowed and rubbed against a plant. Kate picked up Mochi to look him in his eyes. His eyes, which were originally blue, were turning yellow in certain parts. \u201cQuinn look at this, his eyes are turning yellow\u201d Quinn picked him up and stared into his eyes. \u201cHey, you\u2019re right.\u201d Quinn said, \u201cAren\u2019t black cats \nto have yellow eyes?\u201d Kate ignored the dumb question and went to grab more crystals. She laid them out in a line and had Mochi sniff each of them. Kate was going to test the color of Mochi\u2019s eyes. She decided that if he crushed a crystal with a bad energy in it the color of his eyes would grow more yellow. \u201cWow, that\u2019s my genius girlfriend\u201d Quinn stated. Mochi sniffed each of the crystals. There were three that he decided to crumble. To sum it up, Quinn and Kate decided that black cats were sent to get rid of bad and negative spirits and energies.\u00a0\nWhy do most black cats have yellow eyes?\nThey\u2019ve fulfilled their duty on earth to get rid of evil energies.\nSo if you\u2019re filled with negativity\nPeople might say,\nGood luck."}
{"title": "Monster Under My Bed", "story": "Monster Under My Bed\n \n\tThe exact details are hazy. I was in college, my junior or senior year, and it was a creative writing class. We were in the computer lab that day, working on our personal essays, but many of us were stuck. \u201cTake a snapshot from your life,\u201d our professor told us. \u201cSelect a good one- a hard one, a happy one. Take your pick. And then write about it. How hard can it be?\u201d Behind the glib tone, however, a smile; he was heckling us, and we returned it with equal fervor. Mock fervor; pretend outrage. Our relationship with him was easy, comfortable. An older man, tall and slightly stooped, he occasionally read us the stories he\u2019d written himself; and sometimes- ridiculously so, now that I think back on it- he\u2019d pass them out for us to read, giant stacks of them, with the option of censored copies (black Sharpie streaked across whole paragraphs); and uncensored ones, rife with\u2026I can\u2019t remember, exactly. Sexual stuff? Gore? What else could it be? So funny how this professor, teaching a college level class, was so parsimonious, even protective. Sweet, really.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\tAnyhow, it was with this sense of ease that we\u2019d brainstormed out loud, volleying ideas back and forth, our voices clambering over each other. A snapshot then; not the curated sort with placid smiles and stiff postures. Candid ones. Microexpressions of rage or joy; the authentic ones.\n\tWith unusual brashness, I announced, \u201cAt night, my sister used to hide under my bed and grab me. She\u2019d do it almost every night for\u2026\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cGosh, for like a year.\u201d\n\tThis stopped the class. They laughed and grimaced in equal measure. Every night?\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u201cYes,\u201d I said, laughing with them. \u201cAlmost every night. I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d\n\tThey asked the obvious question: But wouldn\u2019t I expect it, night after night?\u00a0\n\tI kept my tone light, but the attention made me feel warm; flushed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t only under my bed. She\u2019d cram herself into my side table. Like really contort herself. Or she\u2019d hide behind the clothes hanging in my closet. She once even tried to hide under my mattress, but she couldn\u2019t manage it.\u201d\u00a0\n\tBut \n, they asked?\u00a0\n\t\u201cShe loved to scare me. It made her laugh. And it always worked. I\u2019d scream every time. I\u2019d check, of course. I\u2019d look under my bed, but I swear, I couldn\u2019t see her. And then,\u201d my hands reached up and clenched into fists, \u201cshe\u2019d grab me.\u201d\n\tThat\u2019s crazy, someone said. Your sister was messed up.\u00a0\n\tAnd then we moved on. I wrote my essay, and inspired by such a receptive audience, I titled it \u201cMonster Under My Bed.\u201d A facetious title, as it was all in jest. A prank on a younger sister, an endless loop until she tired of it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tBut why now, all these years later, sitting at my computer on a random Saturday afternoon, was I thinking about it now? Why did this memory awaken and move through the corridors of my mind, crystallizing into this thought: That my sister, hiding under my bed, night after night, was indeed \n? What provoked it, benign as it was, said by someone I can\u2019t remember, a singular discombobulated voice?\n\tBecause my sister wasn\u2019t the type to be messed up; such a thing was inconceivable. In fact, she was now a proper mom of three. If only my creative writing class could see her now; in fact, they \n see her now- in real time; she had, to date, 354,000 followers on her Instagram and even more on the mothership, Youtube. (Or was it the other way around?) At any rate, she was a vlogger of some merit, an influencer of beige playsets, nurseries with muted colors, casually slung swaddlers reminiscent of ancient Mami\u2019s, pointed acrylics, a sparkling rock with sliding bands on slender fingers. \n\tHer husband was a dentist; a decent guy, devoted to college football and beer-soaked bratwurst. He shied away from the camera, but when encountered, he smiled affably, offering token words with his usual good nature; complicit to the narrative of his wife, my sister, a harried mother of two little girls, with their high-pitched voices and adorable hijinks. And yet, on their vlog- Babymoon in Hawaii!- he was, in my opinion, from the eight years I\u2019d known him, rather disingenuous. He didn\u2019t seem the type to\u2026well, hold the camera, only an arm visible, wearing a white linen shirt (when had he ever worn linen?);\u00a0 and my sister, gingerly stepping over rocks, a wispy sheath of white dress, hair flowing behind her, reaching for him, hand extended, laughing, her mouth wide open, rapturously happy. A filter which made it soft around the edges, plaintive music in the background, John Mayer, or perhaps Michael Buble; a husky croon.\n\tThe babymoon was seven months ago, the baby having since been delivered. A boy. The vlog- Gender Reveal!- was quite the to-do. You can see me, there in the background, rounder in width than my sister\u2019s tight drum of a belly; I was wearing dark jeans and a sensible blouse; she was wearing a dress of indiscriminate color- a sort of urine-colored prairie dress with a simple baby-blue headband; a wink to the viewers of what she really desired. She didn\u2019t care, of course, they both didn\u2019t care, but she\u2019d lean into the camera and whisper intimately to her best friends, aka her viewers, that she really hoped it was a boy. Wink, wink.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\tWas I a tad bit disappointed when the giant firecracker (or whatever that tubular device was), emitted the blue powder, cloaking everything with its residue? Everyone roared with joy. Even me, I must admit- quite the dopamine hit.\u00a0\n\tIt took me a while, but I found the paper. Some digging was necessary, deep in the bottom drawer of my cherrywood desk. But there it was. I felt the old thrill of seeing the title, \u201cMonster Under My Bed,\u201d and the professor's faded red pen: \n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tWhen I did see him, at his office the next day, he asked if I\u2019d sign a waiver form. The university was offering a new online course, and would like, with my permission, to use my personal essay as an example.\u00a0\n\tI was flattered, dimly wondering if my essay was to serve as a template of terrible writing. I never checked, not wanting an affirmation either way. But reading it again, with the wisdom of years behind me, I discovered that my memory belied me. It wasn\u2019t the jocular tone I remembered; it held a bite to it. It was the proof I needed. For what, exactly? I couldn\u2019t say. Such a thought hadn\u2019t articulated itself, just a deep sense of being wronged.\u00a0\n\tI took it with me to our next family gathering, which happened to be Thanksgiving at my parent\u2019s house. Only rarely did my sister vlog there. She also never called to warn me (maintaining that vlogging was best when done spontaneously- although the bigger her daughters\u2019 bows, and the more aesthetically pleasing her outfit, contradicted this), I took greater care, blowing out my hair and wearing jeans that would inevitably feel constricting.\u00a0\n\tNo bows on the girls. My sister in sweats, sans makeup: thus no vlogging. Was I disappointed? Goodness no. I felt miffed, however, as, once again, it would have been nice to have known beforehand. It was useless to ask my mom, as she took the attitude of come-what-may. She never cared if the house was messy or how frumpy she looked. I don\u2019t think she ever watched the vlogs.\u00a0\n\tThe air felt heavy with the smells of turkey; oily and pungent. And there was my sister, sitting on the couch, tiredly nursing her baby. Ben was happily watching football with my dad; he looked relaxed, his scruff longer than what was normally deemed acceptable.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tSitting next to her, I found with increasing annoyance that I could not catch her attention. Every time I started a conversation, she\u2019d half-heartedly listen, and then: \u201cEmmaline! Don\u2019t touch your sister!\u201d Or: \u201cAddy, go grab the diaper bag for Mommy.\u201d And so on.\u00a0\n\tFinally, after dinner, when my mom offered to give the girls their bath, and during another round of nursing, I thrust it at her. \u201cI wrote this about you.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She looked at it dubiously. \u201cYou wrote about me?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\tI tried to sound casual. \u201cI just found it going through my things. I wrote it back in college.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself. I added, \u201cIt was published, you know.\u201d Ah, what a simpering fool I was! To downplay such hubris, I quickly said, \u201cObviously, it was forever ago.\u201d Not even true. Was an online publication for educational purposes considered published? Hardly a matter to equivocate, as she didn\u2019t take notice. What was being published, even to a top literary magazine, in comparison to the shiny jewel of social media?\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\u201cBut why did you write about me?\u201d\n\tShe took the baby off her nipple, red and shiny, before covering herself- laconically, in my opinion. I\u2019d have been mortified.\u00a0\n\t\u201cJust read it,\u201d I demanded, which made her look at me in surprise. I grabbed her warm loaf of a baby before she could protest. \u201cI\u2019ll burp him.\u201d She eyed me warily at my fumbling attempts of holding him over my shoulder.\u00a0\n\t\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cnot like that,\u201d And then a tutorial followed: his body hunched over, his face settling into his multiple chins, staccato-like pats against his back.\u00a0\n\tI gestured for her to read, and with a sigh she complied, her face slightly pinched. And when she was done, she put the paper face down onto her lap.\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt was messed up, right?\u201d I said, echoing my classmate, this voice of validation. \u201cHiding under the bed like that?\u201d\n\t\u201cYes, Anna,\u201d she replied, in a clipped tone. \u201cIt was.\u201d She regarded me evenly.\n\tBravely I stared back at her. I felt triumphant. My face must have glowed.\n\t\u00a0She removed the paper from her lap and set it onto the coffee table, and then gestured for me to hand back the baby. With expert deftness, she leaned him forward and patted his back with such efficient swiftness, he promptly belched, loud and reproachful. A viscous bubble grew from his puckered mouth. We both watched until it popped.\u00a0\n\t\u201cSo then why did you do it?\u201d I pressed. My voice held a challenge. Now that I had an admission, I wanted more: atonement, prostration. But truly, a simple apology would have sufficed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\tTo my astonishment, she asked primly, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d She used a baby cloth to wipe at his mouth, the popped bubble now forming a drool down his chin.\u00a0\n\t\u201cHiding under my bed and scaring me like that? It was weird, right?\u201d My voice grew in provocation. \u201cAnd remember, you\u2019d hide in other places, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s exactly what I want to know, Anna.\u201d She let the sentence hang for a moment. \u201cBecause it was \n who scared \n.\u201d\u00a0\n\tThis I wasn\u2019t expecting. My body surged with sudden heat. I wanted to strike her. I wanted to erase the smirk from her face. Instead I said the first thing that came to mind. A childish retort. \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\tShe leaned toward me, her baby a shield (her children served as the armor she wore; or perhaps the weapons she wielded; or at the very least, the props), and said, \u201cYes it was, Anna. You were the one who hid under my bed and grabbed my ankles. You were the one that hid in my closet, and you were the one that hid in every corner of my room. I honestly can\u2019t believe you would blame it on me.\u201d\n\tI shook my head. Now I wanted her to stop. Now I wanted her to shut up. The audacity! This was gaslighting of the worst order. She overused that word on her vlog. So-and-so was \n me; but I\u2019m too clever; I know my\n; I have my \n.\u00a0\n\tMy thoughts skittered. Where was Ben? He\u2019d gone to get diaper cream; my dad was snoring in the living room; my mom, by the sound of it, had finished the bath; the rush of running water through the pipes overhead had stopped.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tShe continued, \u201cIt scarred me. I\u2019m serious. Even now, when I go to hotels, I have to run and then leap onto the bed, so I don\u2019t get too close. So someone doesn\u2019t \n me from underneath. Ben laughs about it.\u201d (How I burned with shame at the image; she and Ben laughing at me.) \u201c\n were the monster under my bed, Anna. Not me.\u201d And then mildly, \u201cIt was such a stupid thing to do. It wasn\u2019t funny at all. I should have told Mom and Dad, but maybe I felt sorry for you. You really seemed to enjoy it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\tAnd with that, she lifted the heft of her baby and walked into the kitchen. She was going to mix her formula with her breast milk for his nightcap; I knew this because it was one of the tips she offered her viewers: How To Make Your Baby Sleep Through The Night!\u00a0\n\tI sat there, furious. \n was the monster? Me? But what could I do? I didn\u2019t know how to defend myself. I did not have the arsenal of her words. She was too clever, too malevolent; her verbal acuity would only assail me.\u00a0\n\tAnd then Ben came home, and seeing my expression, asked if I was okay.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tI smiled weakly at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\tI left the couch and wandered aimlessly for a bit. A silly thing to do- wander inside the confines of a house, not take a walk outside where the air was crisp and might offer a little clarity.\u00a0 At some point, I went upstairs to check on my mom and the girls. The bathroom was balmy, thick with the smell of shampoo. Addy was brushing her teeth (just a toothbrush with clear gel, safe for ingesting) while sitting on the porta potty. (My sister would not approve.) My mom was running a comb through Emmaline\u2019s wet hair. I asked her if she needed any help, but she cheerfully assured me she did not. She had it under control.\u00a0\n\tFine by me. The care of toddlers was exhausting. I could only handle them in doses, and to be honest, I hadn\u2019t quite found my footing in the role of aunt yet. I told myself that I\u2019d do better when they were older; I\u2019d be a safe haven, I was sure, when they needed an escape from their mother. Not mom, but \n\tI felt unsettled, agitated. I found myself wandering the upstairs. Past my parent\u2019s bedroom. Past the spare bedroom, with a pack n play set up in the corner, a queen-sized bed with the dingy blue quilt. Ben would drive home, as would I, as I only lived a half hour away, but my sister often slept over, she and the girls in the bed, the baby in the portable crib. And why wouldn\u2019t she, as my mom never protested her demands, waking up early and doing the lion\u2019s share of the work. My sister needed her rest, naturally.\u00a0\n\tAgitated. Up and down the halls. I paced.\u00a0\n\tAnd then I paused.\u00a0\n\tSudden movement; wildly, impulsively, without thought. I scurried. I slithered. It was tight, tighter than before.\u00a0\n\t\n\tI pressed my face into the carpet to muffle my laughs. Yes. \n.\u00a0\n\tSmell cannot betray memory. And while this wasn\u2019t the house I\u2019d grown up in, wasn\u2019t the room, wasn\u2019t the bed, there would always be that smell. Slightly chemical, specific to a place that didn\u2019t bear the traffic of shoes, of feet, of spills. A place of safety; of darkness, like a womb; a sacred place. There\nunder the bed.\u00a0\n\tShe was right, my sister. How had I forgotten this place? Where no one could see me, invisible as I was, entombed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\tI waited, there under the bed. Waited as the springs jounced- heavier from my mom as she read the girls a story, lighter from my nieces, as they rolled to and fro. Tears streamed down my face. I shook with laughter, pressing my face, again and again, into the coarse weave of carpet.\u00a0\n\tThe anticipation, the waiting, oh the sweetness. My body thrummed with hilarity. My mom left. The girls giggled. Addy cried. Emmaline soothed. And I cackled into the carpet.\u00a0\n\tFinally, finally, she came. All was quiet. I didn\u2019t peek, the bedskirt did not quiver. She was murmuring; she was holding the baby. Closer now. Closer.\u00a0\n\tI pounced.\u00a0 \n "}
{"title": "Stuck", "story": "Stuck\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cDon\u2019t look under the bed.\u201d Mom said and gave me a good night kiss.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhy?\u201d I just had to ask.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u201cYour favorite question again. \u2018Why, why, why.\u2019 Well, you might find something you don\u2019t want there. That\u2019s why. Good night.\u201d Mom left the room with the door slightly opened so I could see the hallway light. Then again in the morning, the light was always off. That spooked me each time when I thought about it.\u00a0\n\tNow, here is a different situation, I thought.\u00a0\n\tWhy did Mom tell me not to look under the bed? I\u2019d never dreamed of looking under the bed if she didn\u2019t mention it. Why would I? All I will find are half-broken toys, candy wrappers, or possibly a dead mouse since I haven\u2019t heard it running through the ceiling.\u00a0\n\tCurse you, Mom.\u00a0\n\tI closed my eyes and all I could think of was what was under the bed.\u00a0\n\tThere should be nothing I couldn\u2019t imagine.\u00a0\n\tOops, I used the I-word.\u00a0\n\tImagine.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou can do this. Use your imagination.\u201d That was what Mrs. Koncharofsky would say when we had to do any work in the classroom.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat is 7 times 13? Use your imagination.\u201d She would say.\u00a0\n\tIf I can imagine the answer, why am I here to learn how to multiply numbers? I should be home imagining what I want for my lunch and what presents Santa Clause should bring to me under the tree.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\tIn time, I was getting sleepy. I should go to bed. After all, I have school tomorrow. I need to save all the imagination for what Mrs. Koncharofsky will ask me in the classroom.\u00a0\n\tI was ready to go to bed in a second if I didn\u2019t hear a cry under the bed.\u00a0It sounded like a growl. Very light and soft and wimpy growl.\u00a0\n\t\u201cUse your imagination!\u201d Mrs. Koncharofsky\u2019s voice lingered in my head like a doorbell.\u00a0\n\tI don\u2019t want to use my imagination! I shouted in my head.\u00a0\n\tFortunately, I could not imagine anything could be under the bed, but unfortunately, I was not sleepy anymore.\u00a0\n\tI want to sleep! My heart was shouting at me. But my brain said I am wide awake!\nWhat shall I do?\u00a0\n\tYes, I need to find out what is underneath the bed.\u00a0\n\tBut why? It\u2019s probably a cat. We don\u2019t have a cat. A puppy? We don\u2019t have a puppy either. Does Mom want to surprise me with a new pet? It\u2019s a nice thought, but she isn\u2019t that kind of a person. It\u2019s not my birthday or Christmas. There is no chance of that.\u00a0\n\t\u201cUse your imagination!\u201d\u00a0\n\tWhy? Mrs. Koncharofsky? Did you imagine that we need to start calling you by your new last name in the middle of the school year?\u00a0\n\tYes, she was Miss Tanaka, and after a Thanksgiving break, she became Mrs. Koncharofsky.\u00a0\n\tDid you imagine that we had no problem understanding how the marriage system works in the United States? You should\u2019ve kept your last name. It\u2019s easier for us to pronounce and you don\u2019t even look like one of Koncharofsky.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWe all need to accept one another.\u201d That\u2019s what she would say. In fact, her husband\u2019s first name was Mike. When he proposed to her, she realized that she would become \u2018Koncharofsky.\u2019 She was already in love with him and all, so she said she accepted to become \u2018Koncharofsky.\u2019\u00a0\n\tWait! I don\u2019t have time to reminisce about my schoolteacher\u2019s fond memory of her last name. There is something under the bed!\u00a0\u00a0\n\tThere was a cry again. This time, it was a bit louder but still sounded frail and weak.\u00a0\n\tI took a deep breath to brace myself. I crawled onto the floor like a snake and peeked under the bed.\u00a0\n\tThere they were. Two enormous eyes shining like diamonds glared at me. There was a gigantic monster under the bed.\u00a0\n\tI couldn\u2019t see anything else but those eyes. But they were not shined because of the evil power. They were filled with tears.\u00a0\n\tThe monster growled again.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWho are you?\u201d I squeezed out my voice to ask that simple question.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a monster.\u201d His voice was so gentle that I could barely hear.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat are you doing down there?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m supposed to scare you.\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019m kinda scared. Well done, now goodbye.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cNo, I can\u2019t come out of here. I\u2019m stuck.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cI am a big monster. I usually use the closet, but there is no closet in your room. So by default, I appear under the bed.\u201d\n\t\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Don\u2019t you know how big you\u2019re?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cOf course, I do. This is the first time this happened to me. You know everything has the first time.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cYeah, but this is stupid. You know today is a school night, don\u2019t you? I have a math quiz tomorrow. And I\u2019m not good at math, especially fractions.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, I apologize for the inconvenience. But if you\u2019re not scared, I\u2019ll be stuck here forever. Could you scream a bit?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t do that. Mom will be mad at me. She\u2019s the one who told me not to look under the bed. I don\u2019t want her to know that I found you there.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou want me to stay here forever?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care. I need to go to bed. You know, Mom vacuums every morning. Maybe that\u2019s how you can get out of your predicament.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cPredica-what?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cPredicament.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhoa, you know a big word.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you know what predicament is? How old are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cEight.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cJesus, I am nine. I thought you guys are a lot older than I am. So at eight, you start scaring human kids?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, kinda. We practice and need to pass the scaring test. I passed it two weeks ago. This is my second week.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re an adult already.\u201d\n\t\u201cWell, I am on my own.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThey are in Florida. They have already retired from scaring kids. They have pina colada and lie down on the beach.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cMonsters, too, retire in Florida? I\u2019ve never thought that would be possible.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThere are a few beaches just for monsters although we can\u2019t tell them apart from retired old humans from retired monsters. They all wear Hawaiians or moo moos with sunglasses.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat are moo moos?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt looks like a big pillowcase. Very colorful, though.\u201d\n\t\u201cWho, I had no idea. We are very much alike to each other.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou know, once, my mom sent me a photo with this humongous head monster in moo moos.\u201d\n\t\u201cReally?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a monster standing next to her. It was an old lady with a towering hairdo. It looks like burning Eifel Tower.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt was\u2026.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so stupid. I should be scaring you.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, but now I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019m getting sleepy with your nice story.\u201d\n\t\u201cReally? Good to know.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cNow I\u2019m relaxed and don\u2019t even think about the quiz tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cFractions, huh? Would that scare you?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cNo, I just get nervous.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou know what we do when we are nervous?\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\t\u201cWe imagine the zombies running around with their heads cut off.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s funny. We imagine the chickens instead of zombies, but zombies will do, too.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cGood.\u201d And the monster sighs deeply.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be stuck here forever. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am having a great time talking to you.\u201d\n\t\u201cNow you said that I can\u2019t go to sleep thinking about you being stuck there forever.\u201d\n\t\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\t\u201cJust say something a little scary. Then, I scream lightly. Okay?\u201d\n\t\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see\u2026. MOO!\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\t\u201cWell, if I say BOO, that will surely scare you. I just wanted to scare you slightly.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cHave you scared anybody before?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u201cOf course, I have. I told you this is my second week.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat age group?\u201d\n\t\u201cThey are between three to eight.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cSo, I\u2019m your first nine years old.\u201d\n\t\u201cYes. You\u2019re still a child, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWrong, you are. We nine-year-olds are more sophisticated than those nose-running, underwear-smelling muddy foot scoundrels.\u201d\n\t\u201cI can see that from your choice of words.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cSo, you must set up the scene right to scare me. You have some power to do so, don\u2019t you? Or do you just scream like a monster?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cI am a monster.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cSo today is a good learning opportunity for you. You have a long career ahead of you as a scarer. You need to improve the technique to scare kids my age.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cOkay, I\u2019m beginning to feel lucky being stuck here.\u201d\n\t\u201cGood.\u201d\n\t\u201cFirst, you must create an eerie atmosphere. The door closes for no reason. The wind blows in and splatters the curtains.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t have those powers.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat do you have?\u201d\n\t\u201cI have large shiny eyes with pointy sharp teeth.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s scary. Good. What else?\u201d\n\t\u201cI can do a voice.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou mean, you can sound like someone else?\u201d\n\t\u201cYes. Ahem\u2026 \u2018We all love China, China, China, Let\u2019s make America even greater again.\u2019\u201d\n\t\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re here to scare kids?\u201d\n\t\u201cI saw that on TV the other day in a kid\u2019s bedroom. She left a TV on.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cWho else can you do?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 \u2018Come down here, Samuel Moses Anderson! Right this second!\u201d\n\tI screamed! The monster sounded just like Mom.\u00a0\n\tThe door opened. There stood Mom.\n\t\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\t\u201cNothing?\u201d\n\t\u201cDid you peak under the bed?\u201d\u00a0Mom smiled. \n\t\u201cOf course, not.\u201d\u00a0I looked away from her.\n\t\u201cOkay. Do you want me to stay until you fall asleep?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019m too sophisticated for that.\u201d\n\t\u201cHow about this?\u201d Mom kissed me on my cheek.\n\t\u201cGood night, Mom.\u201d\n\t\u201cGood night.\u201d\n\tMom left the room with the door slightly opened. I took a deep breath, and it became quiet in the room. I heard nothing from under the bed no more.\u00a0\n \nThe End\n "}
{"title": "The Redundant Crusade", "story": "After what felt exactly like one-thousand-four-hundred-and-eighty-five years, Arthur was finally beginning to suspect he wouldn\u2019t be needed any more, and that they could all retire just like his men wanted. But just then, the old stone door covering the cave entrance slid open, and they saw a figure silhouetted by the glory of the daylight.\nArthur leapt to his feet at once, his chained mail jingling. \u201cMerlin, old chap! It\u2019s about bloody time.\u201d Then all his knights jumped to their feet too, and everyone drew their swords and cheered, \u201cHuzzah!\u201d\nThe figure at the mouth of the cave stepped forward, and flipped on a flashlight. When Arthur\u2019s eyes adjusted to all the new light, he saw that Merlin didn\u2019t look quite the way he remembered.\n\u201cMerlin, old chap! You have turned into a lass! And a comely one at that.\u201d The knights all murmured their approval, not having seen a woman in a millennium and a half. Indeed, they hadn\u2019t done much of anything in a millennium and a half, other than sitting on their stools in the darkness of the cave, waiting for the day Britain would need them again.\n\u201cWell hey there, fellas,\u201d said the woman, with an exaggerated East coast accent. \u201cI\u2019m Gertie.\u201d\n\u201cGertie?\u201d asked Arthur.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. And I\u2019m a forest ranger here in the Avalon Wilderness Reserve. And, oh, I\u2019m so sorry, but you boys can\u2019t be living in this cave. You can camp with a permit though. Oh, and you should know, we\u2019ve had a few bear sightings nearby.\u201d\n\u201cPsst!\u201d Lancelot pssted. \u201cArthur, \u2019tis not Merlin. \u2019tis not Merlin at all!\u201d\nThe other knights all concurred with a chorus of \u201cAyes!\u201d and \u201cBy my troths!\u201d\n\u201cYou are right, I wager,\u201d said Arthur. \u201c\u2019tis no matter. The seal is still broken, and we are called once again to the aid of our beloved Britain.\u201d\nHe turned to the ranger. \"Brave Gertie, most breathtaking maiden of the forest paths! Have no fear, for we shall save the day. This, I swear to you, for I am King Arthur Pendragon, son of Uther Pendragon, and these fine warriors are my unparalleled knights!\n\u201cAnd this cave we shall abandon anon, for we\u2019ve no more use of it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s swell,\u201d Gertie said. \u201cThank you, Mr.\u00a0Pendragon. Oh, there\u2019s just one more thing, and I\u2019m really sorry to bring it up, but it\u2019s kind of a biggie.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWell, those things you got, they\u2019re not swords, are they? They\u2019re not sharpened? You know, you can\u2019t just walk around with sharp swords after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d asked Arthur. He looked at his men, and they were all just as perplexed.\n\u201cWell, surely,\u201d Lancelot started, \u201cthey\u2019re not sharp at all. We don\u2019t even have a whet stone down here.\u201d The others concurred.\n\u201cAnd besides,\u201d said Gawain, \u201cthese, er, aren\u2019t swords at all.\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t?\u201d said Gertie.\n\u201cNo, no, these are,\u201d Gawain continued, then pursed his lips, then finished, \u201cknives. Big knives. Decorative cutlery.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all swell then,\u201d said Gertie.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled!\u201d Arthur proclaimed. \u201cLet us hie back to Britain, save everyone, and finally drive the Saxons back into the sea!\u201d\nGertie led King Arthur and his knights out of the cave, but alas, their troubles were only beginning. When she took them to the Newfoundland coast, they promptly started chopping trees down with their decorative cutlery, intending to build a great ship with which to sail back to Britain.\nJohnson Johnson, Mayor of St.\u00a0John\u2019s, stopped his pickup at the side of the road and told them, \u201cHey! You can\u2019t do that, eh!\u201d And then Officers Marney and Klampp arrested Arthur and his knights, and took them to St.\u00a0John\u2019s.\nThis was just as well, as none of the knights had ever built a ship before, that being more Merlin\u2019s thing. Arthur found the city overwhelming, with its concrete spires and sorcerous street lights and fire hydrants. When they saw all the horseless metal carriages, presumably propelled by elfish trickery, Galahad fainted. It was all too much, and Arthur used his one phone call to talk to Gertie.\nThey met in the jail\u2019s cafeteria.\n\u201cGertie, I need your help,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWe\u2019re in way over our heads here. They want us to pay some kind of fine, only all I have are Roman denarii and they won\u2019t accept those, and they say we don\u2019t have any ID! How could my identity be in doubt?\u201d He unsheathed his sword and raised it high. \u201cI wield bloody Excalibur, don\u2019t I? How are we ever going to drive the Saxons into the sea now?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Mr.\u00a0Pendragon,\u201d she said, patting his free hand. \u201c\n don\u2019t doubt you, but you boys are in quite the pickle. Look, why don\u2019t you sheath that sword for now.\u201d\nArthur did, looking glum. \u201cThings have changed so much, Gertie. I don\u2019t recognize Avalon at all anymore.\u201d\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d Gertie said. \u201cWell Avalon\u2019s just the wilderness reserve. We call this place Newfoundland.\u201d\n\u201cNewfoundland?\u201d\nShe nodded, then showed him her phone, where they looked at a map of the area. \u201cNewfoundland is part of Canada. See?\u201d She zoomed out, expanding this strange new world. \u201cWhich is part of North America. And see, here? The whole globe, in your hand.\u201d\n\u201cThe world\u2019s a ball?\u201d said Arthur, his eyes wide. \u201cBlimey. I owe Percival a Coke.\u201d\n\u201cI think I can help you guys get out of jail,\u201d Gertie said.\nArthur\u2019s face lit up. \u201cOh, you have my eternal gratitude, fair Gertie!\u201d He clasped her hand in his, and she blushed.\nGertie was able to negotiate a community service deal for the knights to pay off their fine. This suited them well, for helping communities was their second most important sworn duty, right after driving Saxons back into the sea.\nThey spent a month walking up and down Newfoundland\u2019s highways, picking up litter and helping caribou cross the road. Gertie chaperoned and more and more she felt herself drawn to Arthur and his stories. And Arthur had no shortage of questions for her, and was amazed at both her breadth of knowledge and her grace.\nBut when the month was up and their debt was paid, she delivered more bad news.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really travel on ships anymore. That\u2019s just for fishing or cargo,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut then how shall we ever sail back to Britain? My people need us.\u201d\n\u201cWell, most commonly, people nowadays would take an airplane.\u201d\n\u201cA \n\u201d\n\u201cAn airplane. It\u2019s like a bus with wings, and it flies you from one part of the world to another.\u201d\n\u201cBy my troth!\u201d said Percival. \u201cYou mean to say, \u2019tis a dragon!?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d Gertie said, chuckling. \u201cThe airlines might have beastly customer service but they\u2019re no dragons. Airplanes are just machines, like cars. But they\u2019re fast! They should get you to London in just over eight hours.\u201d\n\u201cEight \n\u201d said Arthur, and all his knights buzzed. \u201cIt took us three bloody \n to sail to Avalon. What miraculous sorcery, this! The day is saved! We\u2019ll show those Saxons what for, yet! Tell me, Gertie, where does one capture such an airplane? And do we need a special saddle?\u201d\nGertie sighed. She wanted to help Mr.\u00a0Pendragon, but the prospect of him leaving was getting increasingly hard to bear. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to capture it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you do need a passport.\u201d\nAnd so the brave king and his knights hit their next hurdle, for when they went down to the passport office, it turned out that Excalibur still didn\u2019t count as a valid ID. Worse, the government had no records of the knights at all \u2013 no birth certificates, no driver\u2019s licences, no visas, no death certificates \u2013 nothing. Not only did they not get passports, they were also ineligible for them.\n\u201cOh, greatest of woes!\u201d said Arthur. \u201cWhatever shall we do now?\u201d\n\u201cI have an idea,\u201d said Gertie. \u201cOnly, it might take a while\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve waited this long, Gertie most fair. However you wisely counsel us, so shall we endeavour.\u201d\n\u201cYou can apply for Canadian citizenship,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way they would \n to give you a passport.\u201d\n\u201cThen apply we shall!\u201d\nAlas, the application process was a nightmare the likes of which the intrepid heroes had never faced before. They would need addresses, for the mountains of correspondence and paperwork. They would need incomes, to show they weren\u2019t just a drain on the economy. They would need at least a seventh grade education, and to pass a written test. This new government was labyrinthine and alien, a far cry from the straightforward efficiency of the feudal system they knew and loved.\nBut they grit their teeth and pushed forward. For starters, they decided they would sell jam. They already knew the highways and would set up shop on the shoulders, and of course everybody loved wild jam. They\u2019d sell by day, and nights they would sit around Gertie\u2019s large round table, filling in forms according to her guidance, and learning the basics of civics and history.\nOne night, when they had a night off, Gertie asked Arthur if he wanted to see a movie, and so they went to see The Lord of the Rings. Arthur, dearly missing the advice of Merlin, became deeply interested in Gandalf.\n\u201cWhat a magnificent wizard!\u201d he said. \u201cI simply must find him! He shall counsel us most wise.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Mr.\u00a0Pendragon,\u201d Gertie lamented. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ve misled you. This story isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s like a play. Gandalf isn\u2019t a real person.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said Arthur, growing quiet. But then he looked up at her with a warm gaze, and he took her hand. \u201cNo matter. What use are wizards, when I have the privilege of your company?\u201d\nAgain, Gertie felt her cheeks run hot, and they spent the rest of the evening grinning at each other over popcorn.\nTime went on. The jam business brought in a decent penny, but Lancelot saw an opportunity to move faster when he took a job as an assistant manager at a Timmie\u2019s. Shortly after, Kay and Yvain decided to try their luck on the lobster boats. And so it went, the knights gradually parting ways and following their own paths, until only Arthur and Gertie remained selling jam on the highways.\nThey all still met, every Saturday night around Gertie\u2019s big round table, going through whatever fresh forms the government required. And they ended each night reaffirming their dream, of driving the Saxons back into the sea. But they saw less and less of each other.\nNaturally, big events brought them together, like when Kay and Yvain bought their own lobster boat, or when Galahad\u2019s kid made the Little League team. And of course, when Arthur and Gertie tied the knot. It was a big old party they threw, inviting the whole neighbourhood over.\nAnd then, finally, when their forms were all submitted and approved, and their hard work paid off. They became Canadian citizens together. In all, it had taken just over a decade, but the king and his knights were proud, and more to the point, happy the ordeal was behind them.\n\u201cGood show, men,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cJolly good show. We\u2019ve finally done it. Now all that\u2019s left is to get our passports. Then we can finally fly over to Britain, and drive the Saxons back into the sea!\u201d\nAs always, Arthur raised Excalibur high into the air, but unlike always, his men weren\u2019t as enthusiastic this time, instead murmuring half-heartedly. Arthur looked around at his knights, and he saw that they had all come with their new families, their new friends.\nThis week, Gawain had custody of his kids, so the little tykes cheered him on. Caradoc took a break from filming to go through the citizenship ceremony, and he was there with his supermodel girlfriend. Lancelot, now a VP in a major agribusiness conglomerate, had attended with his team of executives. And so it went, each man stamped with the life they had lived.\nArthur lowered his blade, and smiled sadly. They had waited one-thousand-four-hundred-and-eighty-five years with him, and then a decade longer. \u201cMen, you have served me well. I could not have asked for a better band of brothers in arms.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI hereby release you from your oaths.\u201d\nThe knights nodded solemnly, blinking back tears and smiling. Nothing more was to be said. They bumped chain mailed fists with Arthur, as was knightly tradition since time immemorial, and all went their separate ways, to live their separate lives.\n\u201cAnd what shall you do, Mr.\u00a0Pendragon?\u201d Gertie asked.\n\u201cI shall continue my quest as ever, my love. I shall return to Britain, and drive the Saxons into the sea.\u201d\nGertie grinned. \u201cI think a vacation sounds lovely.\u201d\nThe year it took to get a passport was a pittance compared to the citizenship, and Arthur used that time to get back into shape. Before they knew it, their flight was taking off, and a mere eight hours later they landed at Heathrow Airport in London.\nIt turned out that Britain had changed somewhat in fifteen hundred years. For one, compared to London, St.\u00a0John\u2019s no longer quite seemed the sprawling metropolis it initially had. Next, it had taken Arthur a good while to get used to cars back in Newfoundland, and now here, it turned out everyone drove on the wrong side of the road. Beyond that though, there was an impossible amount of people.\nPeople cheered when they saw him, and they snapped photos and asked for autographs. And then they went on about their day, heading back to the shops, or work, or the next celebrity sighting. And not once, in any time, nor any place, did Arthur see a Saxon.\n\u201cMy love,\u201d he said, plopping onto a park bench. \u201cHas it all been for naught? Did I wait too long? Do people\u2026 do they truly have no more need of me?\u201d\nGertie rested her head against his shoulder and interlaced her fingers with his. \u201c\n people need you, Mr.\u00a0Pendragon.\u201d She beamed at him. \u201cI need you.\u201d\nIt was enough to raise his spirits and they shared a kiss.\n\u201cNow, we\u2019ve come all this way,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you say we just enjoy the rest of our vacation?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love that!\u201d\nThey toured the city of London and saw all the sights to see. Arthur gorged himself on exotic street food, and Gertie snapped photos of everything. When they popped in to a Tesco, they ran into the sitting British Monarch, out doing his groceries, and the two kings spent an afternoon talking shop.\nFinally, Arthur and Gertie decided to round off their vacation by spending some time in Salcombe, to enjoy the lovely beach weather. Arthur had come to terms with his career being over. As he walked down the pier, holding hands with Gertie and breathing in the fresh salt air, he realized he was fine with it. Perhaps he never got to drive the Saxons to the sea, but, he was fine with it. He was satisfied. No, more than this, he was happy. Britain was free, after all. And now, so was he.\nThey stood at the end of the pier for a good long while, just watching the distant boats and swooping gulls.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said. Then: \u201cOh, this is funny! I think you\u2019ll get a kick out of it. I got curious and I did one of those ancestry things, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, turns out I\u2019m part Saxon.\u201d\nNot missing a beat, Arthur stepped back, placed his hands on her shoulders, and shoved her off the pier.\nAnd then he dove in after her, and they shrieked with laughter like rioting children, until the sun set."}
{"title": "I am Staussey, Dragon", "story": "Warning: contains a bit of gore.\n \nFrom the height of my mountain aerie the voices of the men reached my ears from far, \nbelow.\u00a0They sounded angry and full of righteous malice\u2026but it wasn\u2019t a sound I\u2019d not heard before.\u00a0As a dragon of the Gemutlich Order, I had been blamed and hunted and followed by these types of voices all my life.\n \nI peered out over the edge of the cliff that was my front stoop, not worried that they would see me, for this cavern was higher in the sky than even The Zugspitze, the frosted tip of which I could see 75 miles to the north.\u00a0I saw the men with my keen dragon\u2019s eyes, on the mountain pass, as little hairy squat spots crawling like black lice on the pelt of a white dog.\u00a0They, having been born with mere human eyes, would not be able to see me.\u00a0Nor was I worried they\u2019d ever reach my cozy nest\u2026 without wings, it would be impossible.\n \nStill, I was curious as to why these angry men would strive so ardently to undertake what would surely be a failed mission.\u00a0They were on foot, having no doubt left their horses on the lower steppe before the narrow path grows treacherous for heavy hooved feet.\u00a0I tuned my long ears, sharp as my eyes, towards the ravine and was saddened against my will to detect great sorrow in their voices, in particular, the young man who appeared to be their leader.\n\u201c\u2026dragon\u2019s gone too far\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026slay it once and for all\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026dragon steaks for the entire village\u2026\u201d\nLaughter.\n \n\u2018\n\u2019 I thought.\u00a0\nWith an hour until dark, and unable to climb ('\nfurther, I watched as the group of nine pitched two tents and assembled a fire.\n \nAfter dark I flew down to the copse of trees twenty feet from the camp.\u00a0My deep green scales flecked with earthy brown camouflaged me within the evergreens and shadows. I was careful not to reveal any of my belly, for there the wide scales of my armor were of burnished gold and would catch the firelight like a beacon to my whereabouts.\n \nI held my breath until the howling wind changed direction, lest the men catch a scent of sulfurous air from my lungs.\n \nThe leader turned out to be a young man, barely out of his short pants, with long dark hair tied back in a horse\u2019s tail and the faint shadow of a brand-new beard, most likely his first, on his pale clear skin.\u00a0The high, widow\u2019s peaked forehead gave him away, it was the same as his father\u2019s\u2026this was a son of Emperor Wagner\u2019s.\u00a0\u2018\n.\u2019 \u00a0Next to him was a bearded blond man, also in a fine wool cloak lined with thick winter fox, who had to be his chosen man, a squire that becomes a brother through loyalty.\u00a0\n \nThe two scruffy, red-bearded men were at least ten years older and spoke with Irish accents, most likely hired professionals handy with weaponry.\u00a0\nThe other five were locals from the small village of Bergamont, I\u2019d seen them hunting in the woods of the ravine that runs between my mountain and The Zugspitz.\n \nThe emperor\u2019s son said, \u201cJan, pass me the map please.\u201d My assumption was correct, only the chosen man would be afforded a \u2018\n.\nHis chosen man, Jan, said, \u201cHere.\u00a0Look.\u00a0This is where we are at.\u201d He pointed a finger to the map and tilted it towards the campfire. \n \nOne of the red-beards had passed out with a jug in his hands.\u00a0His brother yanked it out of a greasy grip and said, \u201cNo one\u2019s \u2018er climbed farther dan dis.\u00a0It\u2019s too steep.\u00a0Da face of dis ere mountain, sheer this entire side.\u201d He gestured wildly at the slope with his free hand; brandy sploshed out the mouth of the jug.\n \nA villager grumbled testily, \u201cEh now Mack, watch that.\u201d\n \nJan said, \u201cErik. Even if we find a way up on the other side---\u201d\nOne of the locals cut in, \u201cthayn\u2019t no ways up t\u2019other side neither.\u00a0Been there a plenty collectin rock goose eggs.\u201d\nJan ignored him and went on, \u201ceven if we could\u2026the dragon would pitch us off the mountain top like a child playing \u2018Whack the Mouse.\u2019\u201d\n \nI was offended.\u00a0Gemutlich meant \n.\u00a0Perhaps they were confusing me with my nasty tempered cousin, Maud of the Order of The Fleischesser, or \n.\u00a0But that would be silly, her scales were black and edged with thorns, we looked nothing alike.\u00a0She was my closest relative though we rarely spoke.\u00a0She\u2019d developed a taste for human meat and in doing so, gave our entire species a bad name.\n \nA villager with grey hair and very few teeth held his hands out for the jug, \u201cAye.\u00a0Pass it ere now.\u201d\n \nJan took the jug from the red head and offered it to Prince Erik first who shook his head with a frown furrowing his pale brow.\u00a0\u201cBut I \nrescue Fredrika.\u00a0If I do\u2026\u201d He trailed off.\n \nThe villagers looked uneasily at one another.\u00a0I grabbed another ounce of patience and held my tongue. \u2018\n They were an annoying species that I kept my distance from. It was a constant battle to keep my decent reputation intact.\n \nFour of the villagers got up and staggered to one of the tents.\u00a0Jan at last broke the awkward silence.\u00a0\u201cErik. She\u2019s only your \n-sister.\u00a0Is the risk worth it?\u00a0I mean, you live comfortably in the castle\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd so do you, my friend. Thanks to me.\u201d\n\u201cI know I know\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI wish to be acknowledged by our entire kingdom\u2026hell, the world, as \nErik.\u201d\u00a0His eyes grew glassy in the firelight, he appeared to be talking to himself.\u00a0\u201cMy own castle.\u00a0My own lands to rule\u2026no longer a bastard.\u00a0I want \n\u201d\n \nThe red head punched his brother\u2019s arm hard and roused him sort of awake. He said to the dark-haired young man, \u201cErik, sir, Bergamont is verra \u2018appy to have you back in yer home village---\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, yes. Good to be back. A fine village it is.\u201d He flipped a hand in a \u2018whatever\u2019 gesture that made mockery of his words.\u00a0He was lying.\n \n \n \nI waited for them all to retire then stealthily crept backwards out of the pines.\u00a0I flew into the inky starless sky.\u00a0It was overcast, the atmosphere thick with the water-heavy winter air.\u00a0My powerful wings took me high above the low clouds, where the air was thin, and the stars dazzled my eyes.\u00a0The frigid air invigorated me as I sailed through heavenly skies to the east.\u00a0\n \nWhen I sensed I\u2019d travelled an hour, I dove back through the cloud cover.\u00a0Even at this distance above Maud\u2019s lair, my sharp nose detected the slobby scents of rotted meat, spoiled cabbage, and the smelly dander left behind from feasting scale mites.\u00a0Disgusting.\nI landed at the entrance but did not wish to go inside.\n \n\u201cStaussey?\u00a0Eez zat you cousin?\u201d The voice of a vixen in heat.\n \n\u201cWho else would it be?\u201d\n \nMaud lumbered to the entrance and extended her long neck out.\u00a0It and her sharply chiseled black head were the only graceful things about her.\u00a0She licked my nose by way of greeting, an intimate gesture I found repellent.\u00a0My nose waded through the miasma of stench wafting out behind her bulk; I detected no sweet-smelling young human female.\n \nMaud giggled and a faint trail of pale smoke escaped her flared nostrils.\u00a0\u201cVell, if I didn\u2019t kidnap her and you certainly didn\u2019t, ve may have a relative lurking about, ney?\u201d\nShe had a point.\nI said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u00a0I\u2019ll just make it back by dawn.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re velcome to stay here.\u201d She winked a luminous green eye at me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s generous, but no.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to help ze humans?\u201d\n\u201cI mean to unsully my reputation.\u201d\n \n \n \nAs I flew over my own mountain, I saw by the pink-grey light of dawn that the men had risen early and departed.\u00a0Their trail was easy to follow and though I preferred venturing out under the cloak of night, I felt compelled to follow. \n\u2019\n \nI rounded a bend and there they were, on horseback, now heading east, not south towards the castle.\u00a0I ducked behind the lean-to they\u2019d stabled the horses in, it was barely large enough to hide behind, I felt as exposed as an interloper hiding behind curtains with his feet sticking out.\u00a0I chanced a peek.\nI ducked back a second later.\u00a0Erik the Bastard had been looking right at me! \n\u2019 \n \nThey continued trudging east.\u00a0I trailed behind them, though letting them get way far ahead, it was easy to follow their hoofprints.\u00a0After a couple of hours, my nerves had calmed and I crept closer, I desired to hear them and perhaps figure out where they were going.\u00a0Aware that my footfalls made \u2018carumping\u2019 noises, I walked in the flattened snow of their wake.\n \n\u201c\u2026flew this way this morning\u2026\u201d Erik.\n\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll get your dragon\u2026\u201d Jan.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll slay thee cunt meeself\u2026\u201d An Irish brother.\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll take your balls Ryan!\u00a0The dragon is mine\u2026\u201d Erik.\n \n \nErik the Wannabe Prince continued, \u201cIt was big as a blimey house!\u00a0And green and gold!\u00a0Fearsome\u2026 and breathing fire!\u201d\u00a0His voice grew in volume and clear at this last, for he\u2019d turned to face my direction while talking to his men.\u00a0His voice faded again as he turned and faced away from me.\u00a0\u201c\u2026Aye she\u2019s alive\u2026heard her screams\u2026\u201d\n \nI was intrigued.\n \n \n \nAt last, after two more hours, Erik halted the men.\u00a0\u201cThere! Look\u2026\u201d\nI peeked through a stunted bushy evergreen and saw Erik pointing to a dark shadow in the white face of the foothills\nI thought\n Then I felt sorry for it, even though, apparently it had the same tendencies as Maud as far as humans went.\n \nSome of the men were slapping Erik on his back.\n\u201c\u2026great job son\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026we\u2019ve got it now\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I can smell her perfume\u2026\u201d That was Erik the Bastard himself, which was odd because although I did indeed detect the faint scent of lemons, lavender\u2026and terror, I\u2019d never known a human being that was able to from this distance.\n \nThe men dismounted and ran to the cavern entrance, their swords in hand.\u00a0As I peeked through the shrubs, I saw five of them still staring into the darkness.\u00a0After a minute they went in.\u00a0I followed, just as curious as a cat.\n \nAs I peeked around the corner, I saw five men and a woman staring back at me.\n \nThe dark-haired woman was lovely by human standards, about her stepbrother\u2019s age, and disheveled and bruised.\u00a0She had a swatch of cloth, perhaps a man\u2019s handkerchief, in her mouth\u2026\n \nA dragon couldn\u2019t tie a gag.\u00a0Alarm bells shrilled in my head, and I started to back away.\n \n\u201cThere it is! Now!\u201d\nA net dropped over me, with stone weights along its edge, from the curve of rock above the cave. The four men not inside the cave cinched the ropes and I stumbled, my feet flayling in the air. Iron cuffs slapped and bruised my ankles and wrists as I coughed and at last blew a flame hot as hell from my jaws.\u00a0\n \nThe ropes burned, reduced to falling cinders like black snow.\u00a0The men leapt away from the heat.\u00a0Half the ropes were gone, I raised my neck to burn the rest away\u2026and found I\u2019d been chained to the ground, while blind in my panic.\u00a0They had cinched the chain with a winch, to a metal stake in the ground, immobilizing my head.\u00a0My left cheek pressed flat against the packed snow.\u00a0I could not move.\u00a0\n \nWhen I blew flame, it was ineffectual and merely puddled the ice and snow in a trench before my head. I inhaled icy water through my nostrils.\u00a0I sputtered and coughed and choked.\n \nThe excited men leapt around me with swords raised but they did not attack. Erik would have their balls. The Bastard.\n \nErik approached with his sword raised towards my chest.\u00a0He was preparing to strike between my heartplates and could detect which ones they were by the heavy beating of my heart.\n \nHe sneered with triumph into the upturned side of my face.\n \nJan had the princess in his arms, she was still gagged, her eyes round and wild.\u00a0Apparently, he\u2019d been in on it. \u2018\nFredricka was yelling muffled \u2018mmmffs\u2019 into her gag frantically and struggling against her bindings.\u00a0That she was still bound said it all.\u00a0It had been a set up all right.\nI prepared for the blade.\u00a0I was touched that the Princess was fighting for my life, ineffectually, sure, but she was drawing blood from her bindings, the red dripped from her wrists into the dirty snow. I realized, as she must have, that Erik would not let her live to tell the truth. He would gallantly bring her limp body back as well as the head of the dragon (mine) and become a Prince in his father\u2019s eyes.\nAs we watched, Erik and Jan turned on the five men left\u2026and slaughtered them easily, running them through with their swords, shock and confusion in their glazing over eyes.\u00a0The princess, weeping, slumped to the ground. \n \nInside the cave, the Irish brothers were dead.\u00a0They were like two garishly painted denizens of hell:\u00a0foaming yellowy curds coated their red beards, their faces purple with black splotches.\u00a0The poisoned jug lay on its side in the dirt between them.\n \nJan man-handled the princess in front of him, bring her back up on her feet.\n \nErik studied my heartbeat and raised his sword.\n \nSuddenly, Jan and Princess Fredricka stumbled forward.\nJan went to his knees, dazed.\nBefore he could stand, a blast of flame surrounded his head. He hadn\u2019t the time to even scream.\u00a0\u00a0His hair sizzled a second then was gone. As his face charred, his eyes burst, then bubbled like porridge in a pot. He flopped forward into the dirt, his head a charred lump with gristley knobs sizzling where his ears had been.\n \nErik stepped towards him.\u00a0He\u2019d been closer to him than any blood relative; he howled in pain and anger\u2026and wonder\u2026as Maud lumbered into the now snow-bare, muddy arena. She pounced onto Jan\u2019s body like a kitten after a yarn ball, then chomped The Bastard\u2019s head right off.\n \nThe raised sword arm fell limply to his side, he defiantly stood five full seconds, then his headless body collapsed like the pile of rubbish it was.\n \nMaud turned and delicately clipped the princess\u2019s binds with her front teeth.\u00a0Princess Fredricka yanked off the gag and said, \u201che did it!\u201d\u00a0She kicked Erik\u2019s cooling body.\u00a0\u201cHe took me, the bastard!\u201d Then she ran to help Maud release me.\u00a0She tripped over a dead villager, staggered, but kept her feet.

I found her alluring. The snapping of the bones was a pleasant melody, oddly romantic.\n \nPrincess Fredricka\u2019s adrenaline was wearing off, she realized she was turning blue.\u00a0She stripped Jan\u2019s fine fur-lined cloak off him and wrapped it around herself.\u00a0It would also serve as evidence to the wild tale she was about to relate to her father. \n \nI persuaded her to climb my back. She hugged my neck and though I still found humans repugnant and annoying, I was happy to restore my good name and see her home safely\u2026\n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "March, Before Dawn", "story": "I returned home like a fox running to earth, retreating to a place of unexpected safety. It was before dawn and the sky was turning blue at its seams. I took a breath of the night air; it was cool and clean and made me feel intensely awake. When had I last been here, six months or more, last Christmas, before?\nI could feel the debris of the city sloughing off me, streaming from my pores to be neutralised by the salt air.\u00a0The hospital stink losing its grip and seeping away in the pre-dawn light.\n \nThe door of the house was unlocked, which wasn\u2019t unusual. I made my way upstairs and laid my bag carefully on the bed. I had brought only one small suitcase, neatly packed and I found the orderliness of it gave me an immense sense of satisfaction.\u00a0\n \nFirst I took a shower and then I put the suit I had been wearing into the washing machine, I hesitated and then threw in the carefully folded contents of my suitcase as well, you couldn\u2019t be too careful.\n \nThis left me with a towel, so enfolded I sat and watched as the clothes rolled round in the drum. The washing machine whirred and hummed, what a wonderful thing it was, I watched it sleepy and hypnotised. My phone flashed blue, but I let it go to voicemail, too late. It rang again and I switched it off.\n \nThe next morning was sunny, I awoke too early because the curtains in the guest room were thin and let in all the light, which was brilliant and very yellow. I scrunched up my eyes against it but it fought its way through. The house was quiet. No one home. I went back down to the kitchen, one unwashed mug by the sink. Had that been there last night? I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0\n \nThere wasn\u2019t a car in the driveway, just my blue ford parked up along the verge. Gone to work then. The blue sky stretched invitingly out over the houses and down towards the sea, not quite in sight but close by. A walk then, over the downs and along the shore. The town was curiously quiet, too early for tourists, but not many dog walkers, anglers, retirees and other hangabouters. When I reached the seafront the tide was far out leaving a long clear stretch of damp sand, reaching passed the arms of the cliffs. I walked along the beach a long way, enjoying the feeling of expanse, the sea stretching out infinite beside me, the widening kind of blue you long to run towards.\u00a0I felt a pang of loneliness, to be here alone, where we had so often been together. It was then I realised I had left my phone behind, but never mind - probably not much signal out here anyway.\u00a0\n \nIt wasn\u2019t late when I returned, and everything seemed the same. I checked the cupboards and the fridge, enough food, no milk. And wine? David would surely like to come home to a light supper? A contribution to the household? A pleasant surprise?\n \nHad he noticed I was here last night? Unlikely, but he must have seen the car this morning? Seen divined and ignored?\n \nI made my short list and walked over to the supermarket, busy after the isolation of the morning. Some people wore masks which made them look angry or started, mine kept riding further and further up my face, inching up my nose and onto my eyes. Next time David could do the shopping.\n \nIt was 7 before I began to wonder where David was, not usually a late worker. Where could he have gone? Was he perhaps avoiding me? I dug out my phone and switched it back on, many missed calls, nothing from David. It took me a long time to pick out a text, the essence of which was, I am here, where are you?\n \nAt 8 I washed the cup that was still sitting on the counter from this morning. Then I called David, it rang for a long time and my heart skittered, no answer. I tried again half an hour later and left a message on his voicemail, please call me. I wondered if I should call, Anna, Dad? But it wouldn't go through. I tried David one more time.\nI tried to wonder what David had been doing, did he have a new girlfriend? Was he away on some inexplicable work trip? I couldn\u2019t remember what he had said when we had last spoken, when had it been? Two weeks or more ago. He had rang two days ago but I hadn\u2019t answered. Was this silence some kind of petty revenge?\n \nI went outside and checked what I already knew. His car was gone. Returning upstairs, I knocked tentatively on his bedroom door. \u2018David\u2019 I called \u2018David are you in there?\u2019 I slid the door open, half expecting to see him there, lying on his bed, absorbed in some game.\n \nEmpty of course, bed unmade, which meant nothing David wasn\u2019t one for careful bed making. Was anything missing? His laptop? I couldn\u2019t see that, clothes? Well some were here - hard to tell. Phone charger, present and correct. Then he hadn\u2019t meant to be gone long? Would, perhaps, be back soon?\n \nI stared anxiously around the room, willing the objects to transform themselves into the clues that would let me know my brother\u2019s whereabouts. I picked at dinner and called David again, no response.\u00a0\n \nCalling the police felt like an overreaction, didn\u2019t you have to wait some period of time anyway? 48 hours? Was David missing? Or was he simply not here, had he sensed my presence and decided to go elsewhere? Were they all so angry with me?\n \nI drank the two glasses of wine I had poured which made my head feel heavy, the lack of sleep was catching up with me. Rest, and then in the morning, David.\u00a0\nI awoke suddenly, as if startled by a loud noise. A slamming door? A car? David? I sat up slowly trying to arrange my ideas, I must go find David. So I must get out of bed, had he slammed the door? I stumbled thick headed down the stairs. Everything looked the same, outside, I could hear a car somewhere on the estate. Was that David? Had he come back late last night?\n \nI searched the kitchen for some trace of his presence, two dirty plates, two empty wine glasses, I must have eaten David\u2019s food as well. Or he had eaten it. I stood staring at the dishes as if they were some simple sum I couldn\u2019t make add up.\nI had been here, last night and I had eaten, which plate? One? Both? How could I ever know if David was missing when my own memory seemed motheaten through, badly patched and re-pieced together.\n \nWhat was the time? Almost 9 o\u2019clock now. Surely David would be back tonight, and if not I would call someone the police maybe. Anna, I should call Anna and hear the news. I went for another, longer walk to distract myself, it was colder but still sunny. Gulls wheeled over my head crying to each other, the surf was rougher and my clothes were covered in a fine mist of spray. I wanted to pause to hide inside this moment and emerge only when all was resolved. To appear again at the denouement, or after.\u00a0\n \nThe threads of my story seemed hopelessly lost, the future a frightening blank.\u00a0\nI was late returning home, I wanted to give David every chance to come back. I almost burst into tears when I rounded the corner and saw the still empty driveway. Not back. Not returned.\n \nI searched every room of the house, in case he should have returned on foot and chosen to hide behind the ironing board. I picked up my phone and called David. It didn\u2019t even ring this time, cutting straight to voicemail. Was David lying in a ditch somewhere, his phone now dead and silent beside him?\nI shut my eyes tightly and then opened them a little to call Anna. She picked up on the first ring. \u201cHave you seen David?\u201d I said quickly while she was still drawing in breath\u00a0\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was trying to get in touch with him\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cHe said you\u2019re not taking his calls. Look, are you coming back?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you see him tell him to call me again, I\u2019m not ignoring him. I want to see him. Ok?\u2019\n \nI hung up the phone quickly. Trying to call me? I checked my phone again, just the one call from David 3 days ago now. I paced the room, should I call Anna again? No, I had given her the message. She would surely pass it on if she heard anything. Ought I to have told her David wasn\u2019t here? Surely no need to worry her further.\n \nI spent the evening on Facebook, I contacted all of David\u2019s friends. No one who had seen or spoken to him in the last two days, they all passed on their condolences.\u00a0\nI paced the room again. One more day? Should I call the police now? I looked at my phone again, messages from Anna, messages from an unknown number. Who was that? Should I call them back? Might it be about David? Was it the hospital trying to get in touch with me? Many texts that I couldn't bear to read. Was it over yet?\nIn the morning. One more night.\n \nI woke again in the blue light before dawn. A dark figure loomed over my bed, a scream caught in my throat. Then streetlight through the window caught the nose, the chin.\u00a0\n \n\u2018David. You\u2019re here, where have you been?\u2019\n \n\u2018Where have I been? What do you mean? Where do you think I was?'\n \n\u2018You\u2019re not missing\u2019 I said to David, stupid and accusing.\u00a0\n \n'No, I'm not, you're the one who disappeared.'\n \n\u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you answer my calls?\u2019\n \nHe gazed at me in stupefaction \u2018Mike I lost my phone\u2019 he explained gently \u2018I got a new one, which you would know if you ever answered \n phone. Or read any of your messages.\u2019\n \n\u2018Why didn\u2019t Anna tell me?\u2019\n \n\u2018She tried to but you hung up on her. She guessed you were here, so she sent me to bring you back. She's furious with you for taking off in the middle of the night like that.'\n \n'I knew she would be.'\n \n'Why did you do it?'\n \n'I just had to get away. I couldn't bear it anymore.\u2019\n \nYou think you're the only one this is hard for? You\u2019re such a child sometimes. Look' he paced the short length of the room 'I don't want to fight but you have to come back now. It's almost over, you need to say goodbye.'\n \n'I can't David' my breath choked in my throat, tears pricking at my eyes 'I can't do it. He looks so blank it's like he's not there.'\n \n'Dad loves you, how can you leave him now?'\n \nI sat helpless on the bed, the sun I knew, was once more creeping up over the horizon."}
{"title": "Pigs Fly before humans", "story": "\t\u201cWhere I come from, pigs could fly before humans\u201d\n \n\tThose tiny bundles of joy, my dearest grandchildren stopped crying immediately. At ages 7 and 6, it is expected that they have little quarrels. Ones that always end in tears and snot and broken toys. But every time I say that sentence, they stop crying.\u00a0\n \n\tAfter blinking out some tears and rubbing some snot on his sleeve, my older one said, \u201cDaddad, daddad, tell me the story?\u201d\n \n\tThe story, ahh. I start with that sentence, but every time I tell them a made-up story to teach them a lesson. But sibling love is too important for a fairy tale.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cIf I tell you my story, will you stop crying and say sorry to your sister?\u201d\n\tAll I got was a head bob, but that was enough for me. I turned to my younger grandchild.\u00a0\n \n\u201cAre you going to say sorry to your brother?\u201d\n \nShe quickly turned around and walked briskly for her room, sounding a pitter-patter of little footsteps. She jumped for the doorknob and brought it down a little loudly. After rummaging through what I was sure of to be toys and other knickknacks lying on the floor, she came back carrying something behind her back. She faced her brother and presented a small teddy bear apple. Or is it called a Teddy Apple? It is a cotton stuffed green apple.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cI sorry big bwother. take this?\u201d\n \n\tShe nudged the apple against his chest and smiled a would-be toothy grin. Would be because two teeth had fallen out.\u00a0\n \n\tThe elder brother looked away from her and put his hands inside his pants. I always tried to stop that habit of his. I assumed he got it from watching the older kids play around the neighborhood. Those punks always strut about with their hands in their pockets. Hands are supposed to be used, not put away. I always think of people who don\u2019t have hands when I see people like that. Now the littlest punk in the world wants to be \u2018cool\u2019 as they call it these days. But he doesn\u2019t have pockets. So his \n solution was to put those grubby hands directly in his pants.\n \n\t\u201cEddie, Eddie, take those hands out of your pants you little rascal,\u201d I said with just a bit of sternness in my voice. And what do you say to your sister?\u201d\n \n\tEddie reluctantly pulled his hands out and made sure to pout heavily when he accepted her apology present. Although his frown disappeared when he hugged it.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, Merry. Thank you for this apple, I will tra- tre- trezure it,\u201d he said as he pretended to eat it.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cSilly Eddie,\u201d Merry giggled, \u201cthat's a toy. And its a FRUIT\u201d\n\u201cFruit! Eww,\u201d he replied as they both laughed.\u00a0\nI let out a sigh. Crisis averted.\n \n\t\u201cWhat do you want to do for dinner? Your mom is gonna come soon, so we better make something before she brings out the day before yesterday\u2019s leftover.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\tThe kids were looking at each other puzzled as I was laughing at my joke.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cDaddad,\u201d they said in almost perfect unison.\n \n\t\u201cYes, little ones?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cStory time, you promised,\u201d Eddie said.\n \n\t\u201cOh, you still remember what I said? I was hoping I could go to bed.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cNo, no. no, tell us your story!,\u201d they said as they banged their chubby fists against my legs.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cFine, fine. Alright? Now gather around on the floor.\u201d\n \n\tThey let out joyous shouts of \u2018yays\u2019 and \u2018wahoo's\u2019 while I waited for them to quiet down.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cLong, long, time ago, when this old man wasn\u2019t old, nor a man, I lived on a large island\u2026\u201d\n \n\tI looked down to see if they were paying attention. Their eyes were wide open with anticipation. My old heart was warmed when I saw that. Not many times do younger people care to hear stories of the old times.\n \n\u201cThere was a rigid class system. Made it hard to live there. Think of it hard to get rich if your poor,\u201d I clarified as I saw their looks of confusion.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cThe island was a tributary to a large nation. That means we have to send gifts to powerful people every year to make them happy.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cLike the apple?\u201d Merry asked innocently.\n \n\t\u201cI wish it was like the apple, but it's not. It was people. People were sent as slaves to the nation. It was horrible for our people.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWhat is a slave?\u201d \n \n\t\u201cEddie, imagine this. I ask you to clean your room, and you HAVE to do it. And in the end, you get no candy. But if I ask Merry to clean her room, she doesn\u2019t have to do it. But if she does, she gets candy. Doesn\u2019t seem fair does it?\u201d\n \n\tHe nodded furiously.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cThere is much more horrible stuff, but you are kids, let's not get into that.\u201d\n \n\tAfter ignoring complaints and claims such as \u201cI can take it, I am a big boy/girl\u201d, I continued.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cThe way it worked was like this. The firstborn child gets to live on the island. The second-born child is sent to the big nation as a warrior, and the third and after child are sent as a slave. You might wonder why not the parents do not ask the crow for the third child, but they do it because they get food in exchange for their children. So poor parents that wanted grain and milk, even if it meant their kids would suffer, asked the crow for children. And the crow gave them. My parents like that. I hated them for it.\u201d\n \n\tI paused for dramatic effect and to make sure the kids were keeping up. I wouldn\u2019t want my audience falling asleep like that.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cThe first child the crow gave was my older brother. Like Eddie is to you Merry. His name was Inruk. The crow\u2019s second gift was me, Daddad. And the third one was my little sister, Shamala. She was like what Merry is to you, Eddie. I loved both of them. But when I turned 12, I was sent to be a warrior.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWow, you were so cool!\u201d they squealed, \u201cdid you defeat your enemies and rescue the princess?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cI wish,\u201d I replied solemnly. I tried to be cheerful, but remembering that was saddening.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a warrior. But I was forced. In that place, I couldn\u2019t make my dream come true. I always wanted to be a farmer, but I couldn\u2019t. And my sister had it worse. She became a slave as soon as she turned 10. The owner would have beaten, starved, dehumanized her.\u201d\n \n\tI looked down and saw their puzzled faces. I gently blinked some of my tears and continued.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cBut one day I got a letter. It said my brother died.\u201d\n \n\tBoth kids gasped and screamed. They started crying and hugged each other. I silently was relieved when I saw their grief. No one, except me, would mourn Inruk. But even though he died over 60 years ago, and they never got to know him, they still shed tears. I cried with them, and in between sobs, I went on.\n \n\t\u201cThe tribute system \u2013\u201d, I sniffed, \u201cworked oddly. When a firstborn son dies before age 19, it is as if they never existed. It was believed they were never supposed to be born. Merry, it's like if Eddie disappeared and you were never allowed to think about him.\u201d\n \n\tShe teared up even more, while Eddie was agape in horror.\u00a0\n\u201cWere you sad Daddad? You weren\u2019t allowed to think of Bigger Daddad?\u201d asked a hesitant Eddie.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cI was very sad Eddie, but as I told you, it was as if he never lived. When there is no first child, the children coming after go up in rank. I became firstborn, while my sister became secondborn. I am ashamed, but a part of me was glad I could rescue my sister from slavery. I thought that even being a part of the military was better than being a slave. So I tried to search for her. I copied the letter and sent it everywhere in the district. Most of the slaves went to the city where I was stationed because it had a lot of farms. Slaves worked there from morning to evening. I went from one plantation to another, trying to free her. When that didn't work, I searched in different districts. After that, I searched in different states. But even after all of that, I never found her. She must have died never knowing the fate of my brother, died being a slave. I was never there for her\u2026\u201d\n \n\tI burst into tears and hid my face in my hands. I always wondered if she blamed us me and Inruk for making her a slave. What if she cursed us on the day she died. Even though I would understand if she hated us, I wanted to know. To know if she loved the brothers that forced her into slavery. But now, that will never happen.\n \n \n\tMy grandchildren saw my breakdown. But they didn't say a word. They just walked up to make and embraced me. \u00a0\n \n \n\tI was in sorrow for the death of my siblings, and how I never got to experience their love. I don't ever want them to go through what I did. \n \n\tI slowly returned the embrace and said, \u201cpromise me, Eddie, Merry, you will always be there for each other?\u201d I almost begged.\u00a0\n \n\tThey slowly nodded. We slowly drifted to sleep, with them on my lap. I never finished my story, but I still hope its lesson will live with them. Just like it did with me.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "The Path of Blame", "story": "Frankie looked her dog in the eyes, eyes the same deep sienna brown as her own, and said, \u201cOkay Audrey, today we will find complete happiness in the solitude of nature.\u201d She tied back her long sandy blond hair.\nAudrey whined and stood up as her harness was fastened under her belly, the tail that curled over her back wagged like mad, wiggling her butt along with it.\u00a0For a moment she forgot her manners and leapt straight up on legs like springs- like Tigger- until her eyes were level with Frankie\u2019s.\u00a0\nThe dog said, \u2018\n\u2019\n\u201cOkay, okay\u2026let\u2019s go.\u201d\nAudrey was the size of a golden retriever, but with glossy black fur with white patches on her nose, chest, and all four paws.\u00a0She had large, pointed ears like a deer, and it seemed she had too many teeth, an upper canine and a lower one never quite fit inside her mouth.\u00a0She was an odd-looking dog; in the shelter it had been love at first sight.\nFrankie\u2019s thighs burned as she followed Audrey up a very steep dirt path.\u00a0She looked up, breathing heavily, to gauge how much farther it was to the fallen stump at the top.\nAudrey bounded back to her, stopping to acknowledge a chittering squirrel six feet over them in a pine tree. As she neared the tree, the squirrel said, \u2018\n!\u2019 It scampered higher into the green boughs.\u00a0\nThen a jay screeched to get her attention, it said, \u2018\nBoth dog and woman stepped left into the ferns just in time!\nFrom over the fallen log at the top of the hill, came a kid on a BMX bike.\u00a0He caught air, his long blond hair flagging wildly behind from under a turned around ball cap, a maniacal grin on his face.\u00a0He thumped down to the path three feet from Frankie\u2019s feet. He had some sort of GoPro on his head though he wore no helmet.\nFrankie said, \u201cHey!\u00a0Hey, you nearly hit us!\u201d\nThe wild boy didn\u2019t stop, he was soon out of sight.\nIt had been increasingly difficult to find good trails.\u00a0Closer to the city, there were too many people, many of whom were uptight about off-leash dogs, and most paths were kid and even stroller friendly. Ugh. Some of the most challenging didn\u2019t even allow dogs, but instead catered to the mountain bike crowd.\nThey\u2019d hiked the day before, through an immense nature reserve with miles of decent trails and challenging climbs, only to come upon a city of homeless people in dirty tents and tarps and mountains of trash.\u00a0When she came across grungy hypodermic needles and human waste in the center of the path, she\u2019d vowed angrily not to return. The display of selfish entitlement these crazy, drug-addled people displayed depressed her.\u00a0They had turned something beautiful into a cesspool.\u00a0She wept all the way home.\nA week ago, they\u2019d thought they\u2019d found a secluded forest with grown-over forgotten trails miles into a redwood forest housing the tallest trees they\u2019d ever seen.\u00a0Then they\u2019d smelled smoke.\u00a0Frankie had been alarmed at first, fearing the worst, until she came upon a large man, hairy as Sasquatch, with crazy oozing out his pores.\u00a0He\u2019d been living in a hut made of pallets and branches. He\u2019d come towards her drooling and making strange \u2018mmm-ing\u2019 noises until Audrey scared him away.\nWhether real or imagined, the smell of his cook-fire smoke brought back flashes of long ago when she\u2019d been just five:\u00a0\nShe\u2019d thought she\u2019d been a happy child. She\u2019d loved her parents though she couldn\u2019t recall their faces, and an older brother who she had adored because even though he\u2019d been ten years older, he\u2019d played with her and taken her to the park and on long hikes through the woods by their home.\u00a0\nHe said he could talk to the animals and birds, and she had laughed.\u00a0She had no memories of her parents taking her anywhere fun, she supposed she blocked them out for being too painful.\u00a0She remembered a church, a big gothic thing, terrifying and \nfun.\u00a0\nOne day, deep in the woods, her and Brian had come across an injured squirrel.\u00a0She\u2019d watched in fascination as her brother picked it up gently and talked to it soothingly\u2026 and \n to it.\u00a0In her head, she had thought she heard a high-pitched whisper, \u2018\nAfter Brian had placed the squirrel in his backpack and told Frankie they had to hurry back now, she\u2019d timidly said, \u201cB-Brian. I heard it too.\u201d\nBrian hugged her and said, \u201cThe desperate have a louder voice.\u00a0I knew you\u2019d be able to hear them too\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSo, you believe me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this.\u00a0Now \n do not tell anyone.\u00a0Okay?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cThey will punish you.\u201d\nBrian had been blamed for the fire.\u00a0Who else could it have been?\u00a0He\u2019d been fifteen, and you know how disobedient and conniving teenagers are.\u00a0Probably been smoking cigarettes out his window, flicking the embers into the dry grass.\u00a0Both her parents had perished, and it was assumed Brian was dead too, though his body was never recovered.\u00a0Half the house had slid into the river when the retaining wall gave way, his bedroom had been in the basement, his body most likely swept away by the eddying waters.\u00a0Frankie had nightmares to this day, of leaping from the attic window, smoke billowing hot against her back, into the net of the firefighters.\nFrankie and Audrey stood at the top of the hill and admired the green panoramic scene.\u00a0The sky above was still overcast, just the way she liked it.\u00a0It was four o\u2019clock. She was disturbed by BMX Kid.\u00a0His behavior was unnervingly reckless, but even more so, she was again dismayed to have discovered yet another awesome hiking path only to find inconsiderate humans used it too.\u00a0She sighed unhappily.\nShe rubbed Audrey\u2019s silky soft head.\u00a0\u201cOh Audrey, ever the optimist.\u201d\nFrankie looked down as a leafy branch quivered over a patch of orange fur.\nThey made their way down the hill, the fox peeked it\u2019s pretty, pointy-nosed face out from the dense shrub and said, \n\u2019 It slunk out of sight like molten lava.\n\u00a0\u201cWhat? What other one?\u201d\nAudrey said, \n\u2019 She looked as if she\u2019d bitten into a lemon.\nFrankie laughed.\u00a0Then heard a branch snap\u2026close behind them.\u00a0Audrey\u2019s fur was tufted along her hackles, her ears pointed forward, and a low growl purred from her throat like a Harley\u2019s motor idling.\nThe shrubs along the left of the path, twenty feet ahead, shivered.\u00a0A tubby little creature popped out, rolled to a stop, and sprung to its feet.\u00a0At first, Frankie thought it was a tubby racoon, grey furred and barrel-shaped.\u00a0Then she thought it was a small fat child wrapped in a fur coat.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe thing had the face of a child, with a mop of shoulder length hair the same shade as its coat.\u00a0Its ears were pink like its face, but longer, elfin-like.\u00a0From the bottom of its tubby body were two skinny legs with five-toed black feet.\u00a0It carried a spear, its wickedly pointy head glinted silver, reflecting the overcast sky.\u00a0It also wore the same sort of GoPro BMX Kid had been wearing. It was a curved silver rectangle on a pole that appeared to be embedded in the thing\u2019s head; it rotated slowly left to right, left to right.\u00a0Frankie thought of the satellite dish her neighbors had had on their roof, she had been jealous that they had television.\nThe thing thumped the dirt with the butt of its spear and shrieked like a banshee.\u00a0\u201cSCREEEE!\u201d Every hair on Frankie\u2019s body stood up, much like Audrey\u2019s.\n\u201cHey now, Cutie, we\u2019ll just be going\u2026C\u2019mon Aud, let\u2019s go back.\u201d\nAudrey placed herself in front of Frankie, growl still idling.\u00a0Frankie started backing away.\n\u201cSCRRREEEEEEEEE!\u201d \u2018Thud!\u2019 It jumped high into the air!\u00a0It landed behind Frankie and smiled, revealing a too-wide mouth full of pointy little teeth.\nFrankie ran.\u00a0\u201cCome on!\u201d\nAudrey held her ground a few seconds longer, giving Frankie time to get away, then she ran too.\u00a0Raccoon Boy did not follow.\nThe rutted path they followed narrowed, Frankie stumbled twice, Audrey stopped every fifty feet or so to look behind them. She said, \u2018\n\u2019\nAs a gloomy twilight approached, they stopped in a small clearing and looked behind them. A branch snapped in the growing gloom in the woods, shadows melded together.\u00a0\nAs they watched, a tall, thin, dark figure emerged from between two trees. It had four long thin legs, each ending in a point like a spider\u2019s delicate foot, and a humanoid body, stretched.\u00a0Its head was triangular, with large round eyes, it looked like a praying mantis but had two thin long arms ending in human hands.\u00a0The satellite thingy on its head glinted in the ink-blue atmosphere, as it rotated left to right.\nThey leapt through a dense hedge of hemlock and came upon a cabin in a clearing hidden there.\u00a0It looked deserted.\u00a0\u201cAudrey?\u201d\n\u201cThis can\u2019t possibly be its home.\u201d\nA snap.\u00a0\nA rustle.\nAudrey tried the door.\u00a0Unlocked.\u00a0They dove inside, saw that there were three locks and a thick metal bar that fit into brackets across it.\u00a0They looked out the window by the door.\n\u00a0Mantis Man sat across the clearing with both sets of legs crossed.\u00a0Its enormous dark eyes blinked at them.\nFrankie said, \u201cLook.\u00a0It\u2019s BMX Kid.\u201d\u00a0He was sitting to the left, across the clearing, his bike on its side next to him.\nAudrey said, \n.\u2019 The thing\u2019s coat gleamed silver in the black night, it was a three-foot pom- pom with a head.\nFrankie tried the light switches by the door.\u00a0Amazingly, they worked.\u00a0Though the inside lighting was soft as candlelight, she switched it off.\u00a0She left the porchlight on, to light up the clearing.\u00a0Mantis Man turned out to be green. They sat by the window all night.\nAs she stared, she tried to communicate with the creatures.\u00a0She didn\u2019t understand why Mantis and Raccoon did not answer her enquiries.\u00a0All of nature\u2019s fabulous minds were eager to communicate with her.\u00a0She even tried BMX Kid though she was loathe to do so, human minds often left her sickened, she\u2019d turned off that ability in herself long ago, like flicking a toggle switch\n\u00a0But even from him, nothing. Just a \ncold as outer space.\nAt last, dawn came with the flourish she loved.\u00a0It meant hike time, nature time.\u00a0Peace and quiet and communion with the forest dwellers.\u00a0\nThis morning, however, only brought more terror.\u00a0The three were out there, watching.\u00a0Raccoon Boy grinned his toothy grin.\u00a0BMX Kid gave her the Hawaiian \u2018hang loose\u2019 hand sign.\n\u00a0A squirrel hopped onto the flowerbox on the windowsill, between the bright red geraniums blooming there, inches from Frankie\u2019s face on the inside.\u00a0Frankie screamed.\n\u201cI know\u2026sorry.\u201d\nThe squirrel tapped on the window and pointed at the inside latch.\n\u201cWindow, got it.\u201d She hesitated.\n\u201cOh, fuck it.\u201d She unlatched the window lock and lifted the pane four inches.\u00a0The wee squirrel ducked inside.\u00a0Frankie slammed the window down, wincing. The three sentinels sat placidly watching.\nShe said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u00a0You know this place?\u201d\nThe squirrel said, \nDog and woman sighed with relief.\u00a0Like all woodland creatures, squirrels never lied.\u00a0(Though Raccoons tended to exaggerate, and foxes tended to be sneaky.)\nThe squirrel said, \n.\u2019 She raced across the cabin to the kitchen nook.\u00a0Frankie had little time to look around, but what she saw she liked.\u00a0The cabin was clean and furnished with hand-crafted rustic furniture.\u00a0A small tv sat on a low bookshelf filled with old classics.\nThey followed the squirrel.\nThe kitchen was an immaculate 1950\u2019s reproduction in red and white, with modern amenities fitting in.\u00a0The squirrel led them through a pantry door, they followed.\u00a0At the far end, was a solid wooden wall.\u00a0At the bottom was a small strip of wood that stuck out a half an inch.\u00a0The squirrel pointed to it, excitedly hopping up and down. \u2018\nFrankie bent and pushed against it.\u00a0\nThe floor of the pantry started sinking.\nFrankie was about to panic but saw the squirrel was smiling and clapping her hands with joy.\nAs the pantry went down half a story, the squirrel climbed swiftly out the opening and said, \u2018\nFrankie realized with amusement that faint music was being piped in through invisible speakers.\u00a0It was her favorite band, one her brother used to listen to: Pink Floyd, the song was Shine on You Crazy Diamond. \u201cI feel like Alice in Wonderland.\u201d\nAudrey said\n\u201cHa ha.\u201d\u00a0She jumped as the elevator stopped.\nThe wall slid open.\u00a0They stepped into a hallway lined with caramel-colored tiles softly lit by brass wall sconces.\u00a0The wall at the other end slid open as she approached it.\u00a0\nFrankie gaped in wonder, jaw hanging open like a funhouse clown's, as she took in the immense space.\u00a0It was the most beautiful library ever.\u00a0Three of the twenty-foot walls were lined with shelves of books, a wheeled ladder reached the top.\u00a0There was a propane fireplace with fake logs, a vast mahogany coffee table with carved cat\u2019s feet legs, a settee, and three deep armchairs upholstered in deep-jewel-colored hues.\u00a0Six end tables shaped like bears held tiffany lamps. The rugs were thick red wool.\u00a0\nAs she walked past the bookshelves, she noticed that all the countless figurines on the shelves and tables were robots or monsters of some kind.\u00a0Some she recognized from tv shows and movies\u2026Godzilla, R2-D2, Wolverine, the Iron Giant, the Alien\u2026Mantis Man- the sentinel outside.\nThe third wall where the fireplace sat, also housed a door.\u00a0It opened and a man in a white lab coat walked in.\u00a0He was tall, with a high forehead, his long, tied-back hair the same dirty blond as hers though his was greying at the temples.\u00a0He had leather gloves on his long-fingered hands. He removed his reading glasses and blinked at her with eyes the same dark shade as hers, then he smiled and said, \u201cFranchetta, hello, and welcome.\u201d\nShe backed away, her mouth snapped shut like a trap.\nAudrey whined.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u00a0I\u2019m Brian\n Brian.\u201d\nFrankie\u2019s veins filled with ice-water, her legs turned to oatmeal, she caught the edge of the coffee table before she hit the ground and plopped onto a cushy ottoman. \u201cNo.\u00a0\n\u00a0The fire.\u201d Audrey hopped up next to her.\nBrian went to a bar tucked in the corner opposite the fireplace and poured them each four fingers of an amber elixir.\u00a0He came towards her, and she shied away, eyes round as ping pong balls.\u00a0\nHe halted a second, then sat opposite her, pushing the crystal glass on a coaster towards her.\u00a0\u201cRemy Martin.\u201d\u00a0He sipped his and put it down.\n\u201cYou killed them.\u00a0An accident, but\u2026\u201d Her hands shook in her lap.\n\u201cIt was not I\u2026uh\u2026do you still go by Frankie?\u201d\nShe nodded.\nAudrey said, \n!\u2019\nBrian laughed then said to the dog, \u201cMore like Mad Scientist.\u201d\nFrankie said, \u201cIt really is you.\u201d She swallowed half the cognac.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember our parents at all do you?\u201d\n\u201cI was happy\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u00a0Neither of us was happy.\u00a0Mother found out about us.\u00a0You kept your promise, but Father caught you talking to that deer that used to come around.\u201d\n\u201cBella.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u00a0Mother blamed our Father, said his seed was cursed, that we were Satan\u2019s spawn\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat awful black church\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShe dragged us there.\u00a0That dark priest was as insane as she was.\u00a0He told her the only way to save our souls was with fire.\u201d\nFrankie gasped.\n\u201cI tried to save you.\u201d He removed his gloves, his hands were made of metal.\u00a0\u201cI saw you jump. When the house collapsed, I was thrown into the river, unconscious.\u00a0I woke entangled in a fall of branches, a beaver\u2019s dam, far from home. The beaver showed me where humans lived, and I was taken in at a hospital. Then sent to a specialist in prosthetics. It was there I studied with a wonderfully brilliant doctor, a scientist. You would have loved him, he taught me much and helped build this place\u2026\u201d He pulled out a smart phone and tapped it a few seconds.\n\u201cTexting?\u201d\n\u201cHa! Not quite\u2026\u201d The elevator door opened, and the three sentinels came in.\u00a0Audrey yipped.\u00a0\nAs one, they raised a hand and waved \u2018hello.\u2019\nMantis Man said, \u201cGru-gruuuu wimi-si\u2026aaaahhh.\u201d\nBrian said, \u201cHe says he\u2019s sorry he scared you\u2026and welcome.\u00a0I\u2019m working on fixing his voice, his name\u2019s Maury by the way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThese creatures, the sentinels\u2026you made them. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t talk with them, they aren\u2019t alive.\u201d\nRaccoon Boy said, \u201cSCRA! Ganorf!\u201d\nBrian said, \u201cSpooky! Be real.\u201d To his sister he said, \u201che\u2019s in denial. I\u2019m fixing his voice as well.\u201d\nAudrey said, \nBrian said, \u201csmart pup\u2026yes, Sameel found you for me and grew increasingly concerned for Frankie.\u00a0So, I built the cabin for you\u2026and my sister.\u201d\nAudrey said to Frankie\nThe goofy dog leapt up and down, tail and butt wagging\u2026\nFrankie went to her brother and hugged him. \u201cThank you. You\u2019ve saved my life.\u201d"}
{"title": "My Hamster Massacred My Family", "story": " \n \n\t\u201cHey kid, no one blames you for this butchery, you know that don\u2019t you?\u201d The police lady speaking to Sam chews gum at a nervous rate of repetitions, picking dirt from under her painted fingernails as she does so; anything to avoid eye contact. She is as round as a beach ball, so round the top button of her khaki pants is unfastened. Her red hair is short, like the Marine sergeants Sam idolizes in war movies he and his dad stream. Marine sergeants, however, don\u2019t wear pink lipstick. She smells too, but not like the girls Sam knows, which is just his mom and older sister Charlotte. This woman smells like his gym class, of sweat and aerosol deodorant. Yep, Sam decides, staring down at his blood-soaked t-shirt; the police lady smells like a teenage boy. Only worse because most teenage boys Sam knows don\u2019t chain-smoke menthol cigarettes, the ones that come 40 to a pack. The police officer smells nothing like his mom, who leaves the house each morning to sell houses smelling sweet, like roses and summer.\n\t\u00a0\n. Sam reminds himself. His mom \n smell of roses. She is in the past tense now.\n\tHe reads her name tag, Officer Waters, and sees crumbs of cinnamon sugar hanging off untrimmed whiskers that protrude horizontally from her chin, or should that be chins? Sam is only 14, and doesn\u2019t know too much, but he knows enough to know something is up with Officer Waters. He takes a moment to study her from the top step of the front porch stairs where he has planted himself \u2013 the night is cool and he needs the fresh air, away from the rusty stench of fresh blood. Crazy. Here she is, standing in the middle of a bloodbath, four bodies ferociously massacred and she looks pleased with herself. Sam is no stranger to this look; he\u2019s seen it a dozen times. It\u2019s the look Charlotte has every time her phone goes \u201cBing!\u201d with another dumbass text message from that dumbass jock boyfriend of hers, Gunner. (Is that really a name, Sam wondered out loud when he first had to shake the dipshit\u2019s hand.) Every time Sam sees Gunner, and his goon squad of blonde-haired jocks, he just wants to puke. Though now his sister is upstairs, laying in a pool of her own gore, her throat torn to shreds and her blood-stained cheerleader body stiffening with rigour mortis, Sam guesses he won\u2019t be seeing too much of Gunner anymore. Well, at least one good thing came out of tonight\u2019s massacre.\n\t\u201cThis is all my fault.\u201d\n\tWho cares, thinks Officer Sally. Truth-be-told, Sally can\u2019t believe her good fortune. \n. She feels so lucky she struggles to hide her glee. She never had a good poker face, but if there is one time to master one, it\u2019s tonight. She looks down at the monstrous brat she is ordered to watch and sees big fat wads of $100 bills. She takes a moment to consider him.\u00a0He\u2019s so scrawny she could bench press him, and that sickly-sweet face framed by a well-barbered crop of brown hair, matted in parts by clots of drying blood, is pot marked with pimples. A part of Sally just wants to get her chipped nails and squeeze the puss out of them. Worst of all, he reeks of privilege. Stinks of it. Like privilege is dog shit, and he stood in it. She only needs to look down at his Airforce One\u2019s - who buys a 14-year-old the latest Nikes? - to know this kid doesn\u2019t want for anything. But what really gets her goat is his teeth. Sally sees a perfect set of fangs every time the little monster smiles. If her mom wasn\u2019t such a deadbeat, marrying jerks and spending the few dimes she earned working the cash register at Walmart (and padded out with welfare checks and food stamps) on cigarettes and bottles of Yellow Tail Sauvignon Blanc from Australia, then maybe she too would have a set of nice teeth.\n\tSally is a betting girl and would wager a sawbuck that some kid knocks those pearly whites right out his smirking grin the first night he beds down in juvenile detention for slaughtering his family. She has not seen the carnage herself, but she hears the officers investigating the blood bath upstairs puking into brown paper bags Detective Johnson has handed out. \"It's sickening up there, boys, more like a human abattoir than someone's home.\" Not being one of the boys, Johnson told Sally to wait downstairs and look after the kid. She was pissed until she had her come to Jesus\u2019 moment.\n\tIt is dark, past 8 pm. Sam is hungry. He hasn't eaten since breakfast though he dares not ask for food. When your family lay viciously butchered upstairs, their innards used to re-decorate the bedrooms like the killer took cues from an episode of Good Bones, the television decorating show, being hungry is the last thing you should be. Sam watches enough television cop shows to know the drill, but everything happening right now is so surreal, so not of this world, he feels he stepped into an episode of Stranger Things.\n\tThe front yard of Sam's house is a rodeo of cops, ambulance officers, onlookers, and, of course, television news crews. He's watched the shenanigans for the past ten minutes since he was ushered downstairs and into the waiting arms of that human beachball. First, there was one news crew from the local station, then one more, then another two, and now there must be 10, including Fox and CNN. It reminds him of pigeons in the park. Start feeding one, and before you know it, there is a flock in a feeding frenzy before your eyes. Sam hears a noise and cranes his head left. Mr Simpson's torso is lying in an open body bag that a man with a ponytail, wearing a jacket that reads CORONER, is about to zipper close. Mr Simpson is - was - a nosy neighbour, always causing grief for Sam's mom, popping over at inappropriate times of the day, an empty sugar bowl in one hand as he rattled the front door with the other. \"Mrs Baker, it's Mr Simpson. Are you home?\"\u00a0Sam smiles, remembering his mom, rolling her eyes and making an imaginary gun with her thumb and forefinger, holding her hand up towards the front door and pulling the imaginary trigger, mouthing the word \"kapow\".\n\tTwo police officers with flashlights now search the trimmed hedge that separates the two properties - his and theirs - for Mr Simpson's head. It is missing. Sam wonders if Roger - that's the name of his hamster - ate it or tossed it aside. Roger eats grains and pieces of lettuce, so Sam can't imagine he would have an appetite for a head. Then again, who thought Roger could do this?\n\tOfficer Waters takes a handkerchief from her pants pocket, spits into the top corner and brings it to Sam's face to sponge off the blood. She knows she shouldn't - it might be evidence, but she needs this kid to trust her and fast. \"There, there,\" she says, feigning empathy. \"What a night you've had.\" Sam does not know this, but Officer Waters earlier had taken her iPhone and turned on the recording app, placing the phone in her top pocket.\n\tSally Waters has always wanted to be rich. Rich like those women on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Atlanta, even those Jersey bitches. Nothing she did, however, landed a dime in her pocket. Her lotto tickets each week lost; the girls she dated, the ones she met on Tinder and down at the saloon bar on a Saturday night - if she wasn't hauling her fat arse doing overtime - were as broke as she was. Weekly trips to the casino left her with a hangover and an empty purse.\n\tThen, not too long ago, she and some other cops were slurping coffee and scoffing doughnuts over at Dunkin Donuts on 54\n and 3\n when one of the cops, she thinks his name was Barry, told a yarn about a cop he knew who got a six-figure payment from one of those tacky tabloid magazines you wade through whilst waiting in line at Walmart, selling them photos of a crime scene he had attended. Sally's ears pricked up. \"How much?\"\n\tBarry spoke chewing a mouthful of Strawberry Frosted. \u201cOne hundred thousand smackeroos.\u201d\n\tAnd now here she is, Sally Waters, sitting next to a snotty-nosed privileged kid who is the main suspect of what will be known as the Sycamore Street Slayings, the most brutal murders anyone in these parts can remember. \"Inhuman,\" one news reporter will describe them; another will use words like ruthless, savage, cruel and merciless. All she must do is coax out his ridiculous story, dash upstairs, take a couple of snapshots and before she knows it, she too will have teeth as perfect as his. Maybe take herself to Cancun for a vacation. Or put a deposit down on one of those condos they are building downtown that look over the river, where the railyard was, and Wholefoods now is. She could afford to join a gym, lose a few pounds, shop somewhere nice and date someone decent.\n\t\u201cSo kid, you going to tell me what happened up there. I mean, it\u2019s quiet the mess. You say your hamster did this?\u201d\n\tSam shifted his weight from one bum cheek to the next. As we said, Sam knows the drill - do not spill your guts (no pun intended) to a police officer without a lawyer present. Everyone knows that. But Sam isn't thinking now. They found Mr Simpson's head but he\u2019s lost his face.\n\t\u201cWe were having breakfast.\u201d Sam sobs. \u201cMe, my mom and dad, pancakes with bacon and syrup because it\u2019s Saturday and mom always makes pancakes on a Saturday morning. She never gets the bacon crispy enough though, not like they do at I Hop.\u201d\n\t\u201cI like crispy bacon too.\u201d\n\tI bet you do, Sam thinks, eyeing Officer Water's girth, and continues with his story. \"I was just about to help myself to another when Charlotte starts screaming like she is being mauled by a werewolf or something; 'Mom! Mom! Sam's hamster is eating my underwear. Mom!'\n\t\u201cMom gives me the biggest death stare. \u2018Sam!\u2019\n\t\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t put him there.\n\t\"'We say pardon in this household, not what\", My father interjected.\n\t\"'Did you put your hamster in your sister's underwear draw?'\n\t\u201cIt takes every bit of inner strength I posses not to lol. I can see the blood drain from Mom's face, and my sister wails and weeps upstairs, \"Mom!\" Mom is white with rage. She snatches the plate in front of me away, knocking over my OJ, and she does so. 'Now look what you made me do?'\n\t\"Mom is freaking out, though not as much as my sister, who comes screaming down the stairs, a towel wrapped around her, 'Mom! What am I going to wear? I'm meeting Gunner for breakfast in like 30 minutes.'\n\t\"'Sam, get upstairs and get that hamster out of your sister's draw. Right now!'\n\t\"'But I haven't finished eating.' I protest.\n\t\"'Now! Better still,' she turns towards me, threatening me with a silicon egg flip. \"You can get rid of that hamster. Today! Once and for all.\"\n\t\u201c\u2018Mom, he\u2019s my only friend.\u2019\n\t\u201c\u2018Gone today. Otherwise, I will get rid of it, and trust me young man, I\u2019m not shy about sending it down the garbage disposal.\u201d\n\t\u201c\u2018Mom!\u2019\n\t\u201cDad says something. He\u2019s such a wimp. Does my head in sometimes. There are two girls in this family and three boys if you include Roger. You'd think we controlled the place right? Nope. Dad is a pussy and always sides with the girls, leaving Roger and me in the minority.\n\t\"'Sam, do as your mother says.'\n\t\"I scuttle upstairs, get Roger out from my sister's underwear drawer, and retreat to my room, land myself on the end of my bed, cupping Roger in my hand. I hold his whiskered face up to mine and look into his tiny dark round eyes. \"I wish you were big, like a gorilla, then they wouldn't be threatening to send you down the garbage disposal. Then you'd have some respect.'\n\t\"'I popped him back into his tiny hamster home, jumped onto Facebook, and posted that I was giving away my hamster to a good home. This was just for show; there was no way Roger was leaving my side.\n\t\"Mom found my sister some clean undies to wear, and dad took me to my football game; we won 2-1 in extra time and everyone seemed to have forgotten about this morning. I got a few likes on my Facebook post, but no one said they would take Roger away - which was just what I wanted. Then, Saturday night rolled around; I was lying on my bed listening to some music when there was a knock at the door.\n\t\"'Sam.' It was mom. 'Mr Simpson from next door is downstairs. He saw your Facebook post and said he is happy to take Roger. He has a nephew who would love a new pet. So, pack him up and bring him downstairs, okay? Sam?'\n\t\u201cWhat? I couldn\u2019t believe my ears. She wasn\u2019t really going to make me give away Roger was she\u201d\n\t\u00a0\"'Now, Sam.'\n\t\u201c\u2018But mom. \u2018I cried back.\n\t\u201c\u2018Now!\u201d\n\t\"She handed me a Nike shoe box. I scooped Roger out of his cage and placed him inside. 'Get 'em,' I whispered into his little fury ear and kissed him on the top of the head. He looked up at me, and I swear he winked as if to say, 'I've got this.' I stood at the top of the stairs, watched mom give Mr Simpson the box holding Roger and turned as I heard the door closing. Not a second had passed when we all heard a huge roar followed by a scream. Mom ran to the door, opened it, and became hysterical, slamming the door shut and running up the stairs, 'Jeff, Charlotte, Sam, hide!'.\n\t\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I saw Roger, the size of a gorilla, come stomping up the stairs, blood dripping from his front two teeth. I ran to my room, slammed the door shut and covered my ears with my hands as the house filled with the screams of my family as my hamster massacred my family.\u201d\n\tBingo. Sally thought. What a story. I might be able to buy that condo outright.\n\t\u201cWow kid, some story. Where\u2019s the hamster now.\u201d\n\t\"Upstairs, in his house. Once he had finished, I went to the landing and found him in front of my bedroom door, back to his normal size. I picked him up, put him back in his cage, and called 911. I should never have made that wish.\u201d\n\tSally took the phone from her pocket, closed the voice recorder app, and opened the camera app. \u201cWait here kid. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\tGingerly she took a step towards the door, then another and another before she started to move her bulky frame with determination. She needed photos, and now. She bounded up the stairs, past the wall of blood-sprayed photos of smiling privilege, past the forensic team with their flash cameras and tweezers going over every detail, past where Sam's dad lay, his throat torn to shreds. Sally takes her first photo. Wow, she thought. This is going to be so easy. No one noticed her, not the forensic guys, the uniformed officer, and the detectives. This is her life story; no one notices Sally Waters.\n\tNext, she sees the sister's room. She pukes but holds it in her mouth and swallows. It's rough, her stomach churns, and she now wishes she hadn't eaten that last doughnut. She even begins to tremble in horror as she takes her photos, the pure merciless brutality of the slayings. And the blood. How could a 14-year-old do this?\n\tSally carefully steps around body parts, pools of more blood and gizzards as she tiptoes towards Sam's room. Posters of Marvel superheroes and some Spanish football clubs are tacked to the walls, and against the far wall is a bookcase sagging under the weight of R L Stine novels, dozens of them. Sally has no idea who that is. And there, sitting outside of his cage, licking what must be blood from his paws, is Roger.\n\t\u201cOfficer, I thought I told you to look after the kid.\u201d Johnson barks from across the room.\n\tSally thinks quick.\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s cold sir. I thought I\u2019d come up and get him a jacket.\u201d\n\tThe detective rolls his eyes; Sally raises her camera to take a photo of Rodger and sees that he has disappeared.\n\tThere\u2019s a collective gasp.\n\tThen a brutal growl.\n\tShe sees a uniformed officer reach for his holster.\n\tSomeone, something, tapped Sally on the shoulder.\n\tShe turns\n\tShe wants to scream, but only a hiss of air leaves her mouth.\n\tShe drops her phone.\n\tSomeone is pushing her from behind, screaming run.\n\tBut Sally\u2019s feet don\u2019t move.\n\tShe is transfixed by the six-foot-high hamster that is bearing down on her. It's two giant front teeth - as perfect as that kid's downstairs \u2013 tear at her throat, ripping the life out of her. She can't scream, there is nothing to cry with, and so she falls, her blood spray painting the kid's bedroom a bright red; her last moment of life is hearing a bullet rip through the skull of Roger."}
{"title": "Brother broke Grandma's urn and lied about it.", "story": "Looking back on it, I think my brother did our family a favor. Of course, I didn\u2019t like being the least favored child from that point on after he broke grandma\u2019s ash urn. That moment still lingers in my head; the grey ash spread all over the carpet like a gruesome glitter bomb in front of the fireplace. The way it caked and dusted itself all over the carpet and walls. A little got on us both, but the moment mom screamed and saw us both there, he was the fastest one to point the finger at me. The little bastard was always a liar, always cheating. Although I was the big brother, he would be the one to pull the unplugged controller trick on me in the middle of Smash Bros. He left me with the punishment and the duty to put grandma\u2019s ashes into a plastic bag until we could get a new urn.\u00a0\nThe punishment was a sentence of being grounded for two months. No video games, no friends' house, nothing, so those two months would\u2019ve been agony. Every day was a saw-like torture session of pure, uninterrupted boredom, and I couldn\u2019t deck my brother because that would just make things worse. He would leer at me from the stairs, and never in my life had I ever seen him play so much GameCube in a short time frame.\u00a0\nMy brother did give mom all sorts of affection during this time, feeling guilty about what he did but never wanting to admit it. Grandma was a blur in my life\u2014the woman was a mystery, and we didn\u2019t visit her much. The last time I saw her alive was back when I was nine, and when she lost her battle with lung cancer, my mom lost it. She would scream at dad whenever he tried to go out to see his friends, even if they didn\u2019t smoke. Yet, dad would always comfort us, saying that she just needed time to process.\u00a0\nMom would\u2019ve only gotten back to her old self in the last month of my punishment and three months after her death. Dad could go with his friends again to drink and go hunting, but my mother still wouldn\u2019t give up her constant attention on my brother. She would shower him with concern; \u201care you sure you\u2019re eating enough?\u201d, \u201cAre you getting enough rest, honey?\u201d. I only leered at him as he looked solemnly back at me. He wouldn\u2019t cough it up, so he got to stay home from school that day as I sulked over to the bus stop, cursing under my breath.\u00a0\nWhen my brother and I returned home, mom and dad would be gone, leaving us alone to do homework or just screw around. He was still lying on the couch and playing the sick act like Daniel Radcliff. All I did was shoot him a look and go back into the kitchen to get something to eat. A peanut butter sandwich is all I would eat, and after fixing it up, I slammed the jar back into the cabinet. Afterward, I heard something fumble onto the ground in the living room. Peeking into the room, I saw my brother wrapped up in blankets and his boney, white chest pumping rapidly.\u201cWhat's up with you?\u201d I grumbled, yet he didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cFine.\u201d He would sleep on the couch that night, what I thought was faking being too sick to go to his bed.\u00a0\nIt was around thirteen at the time. Yet, It had been four years since I had smelled the musk of tobacco gas in the air. It was like someone lit a cigarette and waved it in front of my nose while I slept. It made me nauseous with how strong it was, so I ran to the bathroom. No one in the house smoked, and my alarm clock lit red at two in the morning. The only sound in the dead night was a sharp chirping of crickets, with something else I couldn\u2019t quite make out at the moment. The stairs creaked as I tried to make as little noise as possible, but a faint murmuring\u2014someone mumbling behind layers of walls. My brother was missing from his couch, and I thought he was just rambling about his bad dream with mom and dad.\u00a0\nThe smell of tobacco was growing more potent, and I pushed on into the dark. My eyes adjusted, seeing more. Below the crickets and the murmur, low wheezing crept into my ears from the fireplace. A white plastic bag sat where the urn used to be, next to a picture of dear, sweet grandma. When I first saw this, I thought it was just my brain being half asleep, and it probably was, but I saw the back inflate and deflate with the rhythm of the longing wheezing. Maybe it was the cool autumn air flowing through the cracks of the house, I\u2019m still not too sure, but the whispers were there, I\u2019m sure of it.\u00a0\nThat mumbling was seeping through the door of my parent\u2019s room, and as I got closer, it became clear it was my mother talking. What exactly she was saying is still a mystery word for word, but I did hear a few fragments. \u201cI gave him a fair punishment\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty habit\u201d were the only two things that stood out to me\u2014mostly because they were the only two things that were clear to me.\u00a0\nWhen she went back to sleep, the tobacco smell started to disappear, and I turned around to see my brother shaking in his blanket. A jolt struck me, and I almost screamed. \u201cJesus Christ, dude! What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIs she gone?\u201d He said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIs she gone?\u201d The blanket rumbled as his thin body shook. \u201cShe won\u2019t leave us alone. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He turned away, crawled back into the couch, and just fell back to sleep as if he didn\u2019t say anything at all. The following morning, my brother and I went back to school. He said he was starting to feel much better. It\u2019s better now because after my punishment is over, my mother\u2019s biased parenting subsided. My brother is now grounded; he started smoking behind the school. Of course, he lied, saying he didn\u2019t\u2014I could smell tobacco smoke on his clothes.\u00a0"}

{"title": "What Happens in The Kitchen", "story": "\tCharlie Cobbler fought his urge to collapse once he heard the tea kettle whistle. He had spent the past nine hours on outlet duty, running electrons from their source, the wall outlet, through various electric cords, and delivering them by the bucketful to workers all over the kitchen in different appliances. It was exhausting work that should have been handled by a younger elf. But, these days Charlie would do any job his foreman would give him.\n\tHis last delivery had brought him to the microwave, which gave him the perfect view of Mrs. Lovitz entering the kitchen to pour her afternoon tea. She had a cup at the same time every day, so Charlie\u2019s superiors deemed it wise to have shift changes happen at the sound of her kettle\u2019s whistle. She was a slender woman, who was growing into middle age with grace that reminded Charlie of his wife.\u00a0\n\t\u201cMove it oldtimer!\u201d cried a young elf with overalls and a pointy hat like Charlie\u2019s and a jaw like an anvil. \u201cMister Lovitz\u2019ll be home any minute, and you know they\u2019re having leftovers tonight. We need this microwave clear of all nonessentials.\u201d\n\tCharlie had been called nonessential so many times, the word had started to lose its meaning. He almost thanked the rude, young elf for distracting him from the incoming thoughts of his late wife. Charlie didn\u2019t need any more rumors of him losing control of his emotions in his old age.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tHe left through the microwave\u2019s back entrance\u2014all appliances have one\u2014and dropped down to the counter.\n\tMrs. Lovitz was singing a tune to herself that Charlie found quite vulgar, but she probably found it nostalgic.\u00a0 \nthought Charlie, \n\tCharlie stepped over to the wall, which was covered in white tile. Every few squares, there was a smaller black tile that was tilted to the side. He walked up to the nearest one and gave the secret knock\u2014the one that humans can\u2019t hear. The tile pulled back into the wall and slid to the side making a large door for Charlie to enter the elf section of the house.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tThe door opened to a large room\u2014by elf standards\u2014with long tables occupied by hundreds of elves who had finished shifts as long as Charlie\u2019s but seemed half as tired. Charlie went for his usual meal after a long shift: a cup of cold coffee. He grabbed a small cup and dipped it into the thimble filled with the glorious liquid taken from the Lovitzs\u2019 coffee pot every morning as payment for services rendered.\u00a0\n\tCharlie rested his decaying, yet living corpse on the nearest seat. He preferred to sit alone after a long shift, but that wasn\u2019t always possible. When Charlie was a young man, one small family of elves was all it took to run a house. Nowadays, it takes hundreds to run one room. So many appliances, so many cables, so many elves.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tHe may have preferred his previous work making shoes, but he didn\u2019t hate his current job. He couldn\u2019t hate any job. That\u2019s what separated elves from humans. With humans, everything is a transaction. They work for money. They marry for their own pleasure.\u00a0\u00a0\nElves were selfless. They worked for the satisfaction of an honest day\u2019s work, taking only a pittance like the coffee Charlie drank. They married for the satisfaction of their partners. Charlie\u2019s eye twitched as it prepared tears. His thoughts wandered to the past when he and his wife would argue about how they could better serve each other.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe wanted to keep them stable, staying in the same place as long as possible. But, she knew that Charlie wanted adventure. She was the one who always pushed him to try new things and go to new places. The greatest centuries of his life were with her.\nIt was a beautiful time that Charlie didn\u2019t dare remember. Carolina was gone, and like a productive Elf, Charlie would redirect the energy he used to spend on her to his work.\u00a0\u00a0\nA high-pitched bell rang and every elf in the cafeteria silenced themselves and looked up to the source of the sound. It came from the opposite end of the room from the door where Charlie sat. The bell was small enough to be carried in an elf\u2019s tiny hand, making an appropriately small size that could only be heard with an elf\u2019s pointed ears.\nThe elf ringing the bell was their foreman. He was too young for the position\u2014a mere four hundred and fifty. And, he never wore the traditional pointy hat of an elf. Instead, he wore a combover for his bald spot. The worst part about him was his refusal to be addressed by anything other than his first name, Brandon. It was unprofessional and made every conversation with him awkward for Charlie. All the young elves adored him.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have your attention,\u201d said Brandon. \u201cHas Charlie come back from his shift yet?\u201d\nCharlie was a common enough name among elves. Maybe he was looking for someone else?\nThe crowd murmured amongst themselves, seeking an answer to Brandon\u2019s question.\n\u201cCobbler,\u201d said Brandon. \u201cHas anyone seen Charlie Cobbler?\u201d\n\tThe other Elves snickered. Most Elves took the name of the job they fulfilled. There were plenty of Transistors and Resistors in the crowd. But, no other Cobblers. It had been Charlie\u2019s wife\u2019s idea to keep their name when they started working in private residences. She thought it would keep them proud of where they came from. She was a smart woman, but she was wrong in that instance.\nCharlie sighed, then rose. \u201cHere sir.\u201d\n\t\u201cAh,\u201d Brandon looked happy to see him, \u201ccould I see you in my office for a moment, Charlie?\u201d\n\tHe didn\u2019t need to ask permission. He should have ordered Charlie to report to his office and threatened to sack him if he didn\u2019t comply in a timely enough fashion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u201cOf course sir.\u201d\n\tCharlie rounded the edge of the room, trying to ignore the snickers of those who looked at him as if he were a bratty child on his way to being punished by the schoolmaster.\n\tBrandon was already on his way back to his office through a red, circular door. Charlie followed after him, opening the door to the support beams, which doubled as highways for Elves all over the house.\nThey passed the nursery where young Elves were being taught how a television remote worked. An elf would hide inside and listen to the buttons a human clicked. Then, the elf used a small mirror to send codes to the elves that ran the television. The codes were complex. Charlie had tried to memorize them, hoping to find a job in the living room, but he was too old to learn such complex work.\n\tCharlie and Brandon made it to a small, humble door with a plaque that read, \u201cCHIEF SUPERVISOR OF KITCHEN.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\tBrandon held the door open for Charlie. Another breach of protocol.\n\tCharlie tried to set things right. \u201cAfter you sir,\u201d he gestured to the open door.\n\tBrandon smiled, refusing to move. \u201cI insist, you first.\u201d\n\tCharlie had no other alternative. He entered first.\n\tBrandon\u2019s office was too comfortable for Charlie\u2019s tastes. There were two sardine cans, one on each wall. The tops of the cans were peeled off and the insides were stuffed with dried grass from outside. They were heavenly to sit on. Charlie\u2019s legs and back were soothed by the sight of them. But, Charlie didn\u2019t find it appropriate to feel at ease in his foreman\u2019s office. In the corner, there was a pile of trash. Dozens of papers carpeting the floor with no organizational method.\n\tBrandon jumped onto one of his cans as if it were a bed and let out a yawn. \u201cTake a load off Charlie. I\u2019ve got something I want to talk to you about.\u201d\n\tCharlie hoped it wouldn\u2019t be what his mind was already assuming. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d He sat down on the opposite can as if it were a couch. His weary limbs thanked him for doing so.\n\t\u201cI insist you call me Brandon. I don\u2019t want to be called sir or anything else.\u201d\n\tAll the comfort Charlie felt on the couch vanished. \u201cIf you insist\u2026 Brandon.\u201d\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ve been pulling a lot of shifts, Charlie. Aren\u2019t you getting tired?\u201d\n\tCharlie supposed there were worse things than lying to your boss. Losing your job was at the top of that list. \u201cI feel fine.\u201d\n\t\u201cI went over your records. You started doing this after Carolina passed.\u201d He seemed sincere, but Charlie wished he wouldn\u2019t say his wife\u2019s name. \u201cYou do realize that filling your time with work isn't going to help you get over the pain, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\t\u201cWith respect, sir,\u201d Charlie\u2019s tone was as firm as he dared to go when speaking to a superior, \u201cis it not customary for an elf to dedicate himself to his work after the death of his spouse?\u201d\n\tBrandon paused for a moment, considering his response. \u201cYes, but isn\u2019t that a little old-fashioned?\u201d\n\t\u201cSir\u2026\u201d he remembered his request and corrected himself, \u201cBrandon, I am over nine-hundred years old. I am \u2018a little old-fashioned.\u2019\u201d\n\tBrandon sat up, mirroring Charlie\u2019s position on the opposite can. \u201cAt the rate you\u2019re going, you\u2019ll work yourself to death. And, that might not be an exaggeration.\u201d\n\tCharlie stood and adjusted his overalls to make sure they looked smart. \u201cThen, so be it. Would an elf ever be prouder than to be found dead at his post after excelling at his work for his house?\u201d\n\tBrandon started to speak, but\u2014in a move that shocked himself\u2014Charlie interrupted him. \u201cI\u2019d like to get started back to work as soon as possible. Please assign me to the next shift.\u201d With that, Charlie started for the door.\n\t\u201cYou \ngot off a double shift,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d\n\t\u201cSomeone must show these young elves how to do a good job.\u201d Charlie\u2019s hand was on the small door knob.\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Charlie.\u201d Brandon\u2019s tone turned dour, like how the doctor\u2019s had when he told Charlie that his wife\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t going to improve. \u201cYou\u2019ve not been doing a good job.\u201d\n\tCharlie spun around, realizing the true reason he was here.\n\tBrandon couldn\u2019t look Charlie in the eye. \u201cYour productivity is way down. You can\u2019t run through a power cable, delivering electrons with the same speed a younger elf can.\u201d\n\tThe truth was spoken. And, it was the worst possibility Charlie\u2019s mind could imagine. It was something he already knew to be fact. But, in the past, he could lie to himself and say that the other elves wouldn\u2019t mind if he were a little slower than them. They could learn from his wisdom and experience. What foolishness.\n\tCharlie\u2019s anger subsided as he realized there was nothing for him to do but retire. He\u2019d spend the rest of his days wandering across the support beams, chatting with those who\u2019d bother to take an interest, living without purpose. Being alone.\n\tCharlie never could have imagined himself crying in front of his foreman. He wasn\u2019t some young pup being chewed out for the first time. But, he was weeping, unable to control the fear and sadness inside him from leaking out in a liquid form.\n\tBrandon stood, walked over to Charlie, and embraced him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\tCharlie understood his soon-to-be former employer\u2019s predicament. No one wanted a sad, old elf crying in their office. But, he also wanted to slap Brandon for patronizing him. \u201cHow can you say any of this is okay? You\u2019re condemning the rest of my life to misery.\u201d\n\tBrandon actually laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little dramatic?\u201d\n\t\u201cCertainly not!\u201d Charlie knew he\u2019d regret his words and tone later, but he\u2019d say his peace. \u201cYou want to rid me of the one thing that brings me satisfaction because I don\u2019t measure up to your productivity quota. You are a cruel elf, with no sense of dignity, nor true appreciation of your employees.\u201d\n\t\u201cCharlie!\u201d Brandon brought his hands up as if he were trying to calm him. \u201cLet me finish before you bite my head off. I knew you wouldn\u2019t want to give up work entirely, so I sent out a few letters about you.\u201d\n\tThe embarrassment Charlie anticipated earlier hit him like a hammer. \u201cYou did what?\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, most of the elves I contacted didn\u2019t like the idea of hiring someone pushing a thousand. But, a cousin of mine seemed interested.\u201d Brandon walked to the back of his office to a pile of papers stacked in the corner.\u00a0\n\tCharlie had assumed the papers were part of a trash pile. He was surprised as Brandon skimmed through the pile, snatched up a folded sheet, and brought it over for Charlie to read. There must be some system in place that Charlie had never considered.\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s gonna run a new factory in the city as soon as it opens up. He thinks you would be a great asset.\u201d\n\tThe momentary hope that Charlie had vanished. He refused to take the paper. \u201cI have never worked in a factory. Eight hundred years ago, I worked in a cobbler\u2019s shop, and have been in private residences for the past several centuries. I am too old to learn a new trade. Thank you for trying to help. And, I am so sorry for speaking to you the way I did.\u201d\n\tBrandon cocked an eyebrow. He grabbed Charlie by the wrist and placed the folded paper in his hand. \u201cRead the letter.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\tCharlie unfolded it. His eyes struggled to read the small letters, but the point came across as a smile formed on Charlie\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s a shoe factory?\u201d\n\tBrandon nodded. \u201cHe needs an expert on how shoes were made in the old days. He wants to bring back that elf quality that shoes have been missing. But, I\u2019ll only write back to my cousin if you promise you won\u2019t work yourself too hard.\u201d\n\tCharlie\u2019s hands shook as he read the letter over and over. But, his thoughts kept going back to Carolina, and how she always pushed him to new adventures. He supposed one more wouldn\u2019t hurt."}
{"title": "I'll Never Desert You", "story": " \nMy eyes fluttered open at the first light of day. Grayish hues scattered across the dawn-lit sky, the ambient rays of the rising sun peaking over the distant horizon, and beaming down trace amounts of warmth to a cold desert. I sat up and watched it for a bit, my eyes blinking lazily while I tried to find the energy to get myself up. I wished I could stay, lay on the soft grass, and enjoy the full extent of the morning, but unfortunately, duty called. I looked around the hidden oasis.\n\tEverything seemed so still and beautiful at this hour. I yawned, did a couple of stretches to get the blood moving, and then stood.\nI started making my way over to the center of the oasis where the waters pooled, its' surface as smooth as glass. Along the way, I passed the boulder where Mr. Lizard waited for the sun to warm his reptilian blood.\u00a0\n\t\u201cHello, Mr. Lizard,\u201d I said. \u201cHow are you this fine morning?\u201d\n\tMr. Lizard slowly craned his head up at me and blinked each eye.\n\t\u201cGood, I suppose,\u201d he grumbled.\n\t\u201cOh, come now. Today looks like it's gonna be a good one.\u201d\n\tMr. Lizard closed his eyes, flattened himself out, and mumbled something I could not understand.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\t\u201cTalk to me later, Gary.\u201d\n\t\u201cOh.\u201d\n \n\t\n \n\tThere was a flapping of wings overhead and then a falcon perched itself atop one of the trees bordering the waters of the oasis.\u00a0\n\t\u201cAhh, Gary!\u201d she called, \u201cgood morning to you.\u201d\n\t\u201cGood morning, Ms. Falcon,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cWhat news do you bring?\u201d\n\t\u201cSo far, it looks like you might have three today.\u201d\n\t\u201cThree you say?\u201d\n\t\u201cYup, they are walking the South Dune trail and have been for some time now. They\u2019ll need a resupply of water before nightfall. Better get moving.\u201d\n\t\u201cThanks for the update.\u201d\n\tMs. Falcon screeched, flapped her wings, and departed to the north. I made my way over to the pool and leaned over its reflective edge, my long neck craning down to its pristine surface. Staring back at me was my reflection: A smiling, happy camel. I loved my job of bringing water to people in need. It was a trade I learned from my former master.\n\tA great man he was, possessing nothing but the desire to help others in need. He lived out here, in this oasis, living a hermit\u2019s life and he was my most cherished friend. During the day, we would walk the dunes together, looking for weary travelers, and every night, when we would return, we would gaze up at the night sky while he gently pet me behind the ear until I fell asleep. Unfortunately, a few years back, he accidentally stepped on a scorpion's nest and the vile things stung him. He died but I vowed to continue what he started, delivering water to people in need until I drew my last breath.\u00a0\n\tJust as I had done many times before, I began transferring mouthfuls of water into a 3ft wooden barrel with a leather strap attached to it. It was a tedious chore, and just as I was finishing, Mrs. Squirrel and her family came from their burrow and sat next to me. Once done, the family hoisted the nearby wooden lid and used its latches to secure it to the barrel. I slid my head through the strap, and Mrs. Squirrel adjusted the neck pad. Then, I hoisted the barrel up and allowed it to slide down to the base of my neck. Once the family fitted the strap, I started on my journey.\u00a0\n\t\u201cHave a good day at work, Gary!\u201d Mrs. Squirrel called.\u00a0\n\t\u201cThanks!\u201d I shouted back and then set out across the sandy dunes in search of the three travelers.\u00a0\n \n\tAfter about 12 miles, I came across the first who struggled his way up a large dune. As I approached, he looked at me, his black eyes peering through the long, gray scarf wrapped around his head and covering his face from the sun. The pack he carried looked dangerously flat. We walked toward each other and, once together, I stood still while he filled his water skins from the barrel. When he was finished, he reached up and pet the top of my head. I smiled.\n\t\u201cThank you,\u201d the man said and then patted my hump and continued on his way.\u00a0\n \n\tA few hours later, I found the second traveler and replenished his water supply. After scratching me beneath my chin and petting my neck, he too continued on his way.\u00a0\n \n\t\n \n\tI hunted the dunes for the third traveler but, as the sun\u2019s heat intensified, I started to fear the worst. I had about another hour left before I had to turn around and head back to the oasis as the desert wasn\u2019t safe at night. That\u2019s when the predators came out and they loved to ambush unsuspecting prey. Just as I was about to give up, I saw a small shape in the distance, laying on the shaded side of a large dune.\n \n\t\n\tI ran as fast as I could, water sloshing around in the barrel with each trot, some of it dripping out through the tap. When I finally saw what it was, I gasped. It was an adolescent man. A nervousness took hold of me. Young men made up for most of those who died in the desert\u2014always wanting to push the boundaries of their limitations but lacking the experience to do so.\u00a0\n\tI ran to him. He did not move. I placed one of my feet on his chest and slowly rocked him back and forth. He still did not move. I kicked him. He did not make a sound. Eventually, I did the one thing my late master told me never to do and spat. The thick globule of saliva hurtled through the hot air with deadly accuracy, splattering on his face. \n\tFinally, the man stirred, spittering and sputtering to keep the spit from entering his mouth. After he wiped his eyes with the back of his sleeve, he looked up at me as if I were sent from the heavens, and used my leg as a brace to pick himself up.\u00a0\n\tHe filled his two canteens with water, drank half of one, and then filled it again. Finally, he pet my neck and said, \u201cThank you, Mr. Camel. I would have been lost without you.\u201d\nI smiled and he continued on his way. I trailed behind him for a bit to ensure he was okay and then headed back to the oasis, arriving just as the sun touched the western horizon.\u00a0\n\t\u201cGary!\u201d Mr. Lizard called once I was in sight. \u201cHow\u2019d you do today?\u201d\n\t\u201cThree for three today.\u201d\n\t\u201cNice job.\u201d\n\tI walked over to the pool and set the barrel down at the shore. After taking many gulps of water for myself and grazing on some grass, I laid down between two bushy shrubs. Mr. Lizard skittered over, climbed up my side, and started licking the back of my neck where the leather strap rubbed my skin raw. Once the numbing compounds of his saliva started to work their magic, I gave a lazy yawn and stared off toward the west and waited for the colors of the sunset to paint themselves across the sky. Just like the morning, all was still and quiet and it was times like these when I missed my master, terribly. I looked over to the side of the oasis. A bleached white skeleton lay atop a fertile patch of grass, bones picked clean, courtesy of Mr. Buzzard. A single tear streamed down my fuzzy cheek.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\t\n \n\tThen, I lay my head down and was fast asleep, eager to start the next day.\u00a0\n \n "}
{"title": "Fables and Famine", "story": "Content Warning: humorous fairy-tale references to child-eating witches.\nOnce upon a time, an old woman lived in a shoe. She had so many children that she didn\u2019t know what to do. How an elderly dame beyond childbearing age acquired so many younglings when residing in a boot is a story for another day. Perhaps we might technically call it a cautionary tale.\nThe rhyme next informed us that the poor, beleaguered caretaker fed her foundlings some broth without bread and sent them to bed. (Note: broth is even thinner than gruel, which is in turn poor man\u2019s porridge).\nDear reader: have you ever seen a hungry child fall asleep without whinging incessantly? Or, for that matter, even a fully fed child? Perhaps we should revise that line to say that the aged lady \u2018tried\u2019 to send them to bed. Except that the stanza no longer scans correctly due to the additional syllables. Phooey. Either way, this is where our yarn departs from the traditional narrative.\nDriven to distraction by the sniveling and lack of (blissfully quiet) snoozing children, the long-lived and long-suffering matriarch decided to visit her sister to ask for advice. Because she obviously wouldn\u2019t have any peaceful reading time after bedtime that night anyway. Oh\u2026 you didn\u2019t know she had a sister? Just because she had all custody of all those children, you assumed she had no other family? That\u2019s a little presumptuous and over-familiar, isn\u2019t it?\nOver their horrified objections, our heroine set the four oldest children (each a full fifteen or sixteen years old) in charge of the others for the remainder of the night and departed her leathery abode for the shadowy and silent woods. A pleasant breeze stirred the evening air, accompanied by the droning hum of crickets and the sporadic vocalizations of a particular vociferously opinionated owl.\n, she thought. \nBriefly, she considered abandoning her errand altogether and absconding for the nearest market-town to escape her weighty responsibilities. Surely it would be far simpler to feed one mouth than eleven\u2026sixteen\u2026 twenty\u2026 well, however many mouths it was that occupied her footwear residence. Yet she rapidly and reluctantly acknowledged the unseemliness of her speculation; rather than a flighty milkmaid of nineteen years, she was a mature widow with sixty-four winters behind her. She was supposed to be above such frivolity.\nPerhaps another venerable matron might have shrunk from entering the poorly illuminated woods where many dangerous fables and mythological beasts (and perhaps a jabberwocky or two) undoubtedly lived on a moon-dark night. Yet, as our story is set in the land of fairy-tales, it so happens that the lady\u2019s older sister was a witch. A very dangerous witch. In fact, let us acknowledge that the witch owned a cottage constructed of candy, cake, and other sweets, and that she subsisted primarily on a diet of small children who strayed into the forest.\nAs all denizens of fairy-tale land who survive for more than a few decades have at least a passing acquaintance with the origin stories of their fellow residents, none of the other inhabitants of the forest would consider interfering with the shoekeeper due to her blood-relationship with the witch. Particularly after what happened to the last set of pigeons that dared to nibble on the witch\u2019s cottage\u2019s gingerbread shutters\u2026\nThus, the bold beldame resolutely set her feet on the thicket-overgrown path that led into the very depths of the woods. \n, she shrugged.\nAs she penetrated into the dark heart of the forest, vines slithered serpentinely down tree trunks and groped towards her as if they had eyes and intelligence, winding ominously about her left ankle and tugging tentatively. Dead leaves and branches drenched in dew crunched underfoot, rendering her footing treacherous.\n\u201cCease and desist!\u201d she barked. \u201cMy patience grows slim tonight. You know who I am. Having ventured forth in search of my sister\u2019s wise counsel, I shall not be dissuaded by unnaturally animated vegetation. In fact, I could use some greens in my diet these days. Broth and gruel grow tedious quite rapidly.\u201d\nThe vines promptly recoiled.\nOut of nowhere, as if rising from the very dirt beneath her feet, an indistinct figure appeared before her. Valiantly, she suppressed a startled jump. In the distance, as she peered between ominously gnarled trees, she could just make out the outlines of the witch\u2019s cottage. Now that she concentrated, she could also smell the same aroma of densely concentrated sugar that surrounded a bakery in the early morning hours. The shadow-shrouded individual stepped toward her.\n\u201cBertha,\u201d gushed the witch with outstretched arms, as if they had not seen each other for ten years, rather than having drank tea together last Tuesday. \u201cI am delighted to see you. What urgent errand carries you into my woods this late on a moonless night?\u201d\n\u201cGiselle,\u201d she\u2026 or, rather, \nanswered. Surely you have guessed by now, dear reader!\nMy sister\u2019s body felt comfortably soft and pillow-like in my arms. She\u2019d clearly eaten heavily and recently. I hoped that meant there were no children currently caged in her hut; I could never fully suppress a feeling of helpless guilt during my visits when one was present. Their whimpering sobs made my crumpets taste oddly sour and my tea unnaturally salty. Yet I did not wish to starve my sister. \u201cI wish your counsel on an important matter,\u201d I continued, ending our embrace reluctantly.\n\u201cIs this an official or unofficial consultation?\u201d my sister demanded peckishly, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cBecause, if it\u2019s official, you know a price must be paid in exchange for access to a witch\u2019s preternatural wisdom.\u201d\nI sighed. \n \u201cAn unofficial consultation only,\u201d I clarified.\n\u201cAre you certain?\u201d she pressed eagerly. \u201cYou know my price. Could you not spare just a few children?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Giselle. I cannot,\u201d I retorted. \u201cThe rules that govern me are just as rigid as the rules that govern you. Would you be more comfortable with an informal question if I asked over tea?\u201d\n\u201cBertha, it\u2019s almost midnight,\u201d she answered flatly. \u201cNo tea. Not even one?\n\u201cA night-cap, then?\u201d I parried.\nLetting out an impatient sigh, Giselle huffed, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s have it then.\u201d\n\u201cDear sister,\u201d I began, choosing my words carefully to avoid any implication that I was posing a formal request for advice. \u201cAs you might imagine, feeding fourteen\u2026 seventeen\u2026 twenty-one\u2026 oh, however many children\u2026 rapidly becomes quite expensive.\u201d\n\u201cI already told you I could help you with that,\u201d Giselle muttered under her breath. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that you didn\u2019t like my first suggestion.\u201d\nSummoning up the withering look I generally deployed when the nefarious little spawn were attempting to garrote each other with my home\u2019s oversized boot-laces or engaging in similar socially impermissible activities, I firmly declared, \u201cI will not hear another word on this point, Giselle. I can no more deliver them to you than I could sell them into slavery. While witches are permitted to consume children, the conventions are quite clear that surrogate parents are prohibited from participating in such activity. Unless they\u2019re wicked stepmothers, which I\u2019m not. That loophole is closed to me.\u201d\n\u201cNot even one of them was Waldo\u2019s?\u201d she interrupted incredulously.\n\u201cNo, Giselle. Sadly, none of them belonged to my dear late husband.\u201d Thus, I couldn\u2019t be a wicked stepmother and, thus, I couldn\u2019t funnel any surplus children in her direction.\n\u201cThen how did you end up with so many\u2026?\u201d she sputtered.\nI cleared my throat. \u201cWe\u2019re traveling a bit far afield conversationally here, Giselle. Let\u2019s focus on the solution instead of fighting the hypothetical scenario. Just assume that I \n to feed the children and I can\u2019t afford enough food for all of them. You\u2019re the one with a house made of baked goods: what\u2019s your secret? Surely it can\u2019t be cheap to replace the various fixtures that have been devoured by passing children. Do you have some sort of inside connection with a reasonably priced bulk supplier?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d my sister scoffed dismissively. \u201cNo such luck. I worked out a trade with a baker. He periodically requires four-and-twenty blackbirds to bake into a pie to set before one king or another. I transform the skinny children that I don\u2019t eat and the ones with sweet voices into blackbirds. He doesn\u2019t ask any awkward questions about where the birds come from and dedicates one day every fortnight exclusively to baking for me. Though I doubt I can renegotiate with him to obtain sufficient provender for your massive flock of foundlings. He already periodically wails that I am taking advantage of him and starving his family. Hardly likely: I\u2019ve seen the well-fed little butterballs he calls children. And to think he won\u2019t sell me any of \n either\u2026\u201d she pouted, a gesture that highlighted her puffy lips and make her look rather like a fish. \u201cKings must pay extremely well for singing pies.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that, during any of your\u2026 consultations\u2026 you\u2019ve encountered a wicked queen or a previously-cursed princess looking for household help?\u201d I tried instead. \u201cNone of the children are particularly gifted when it comes to cleaning, but a few of them can do wonders in the kitchen with tree roots, mushrooms, the occasional pile of unripe berries, and bone-marrow. I\u2019m sure that with some brief training and access to the standard contents of a castle pantry, they could become excellent cooks.\u201d\nGiselle\u2019s eyes closed briefly and a disturbing smile, composed of equal parts smugness and wistful hunger, crossed her wrinkled features. \u201cAh, bone-marrow,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI do so like to crack their brittle little bones and spread the gooey insides along my rolls like jam. Honestly, Bertha, are you truly, \n certain\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cGiselle,\u201d I grated through clenched teeth. \u201cI really need you to move past the idea of eating your honorary nieces and nephews. Besides, we don\u2019t have enough food. They\u2019re too skinny to eat, unlike the human veal you usually cage up. And they would make terrible blackbirds to bake in a pie: they would squawk and squabble raucously rather than sing. Trust me: I already would have sent some of them out to sing for their supper if they showed any musical talent whatsoever.\u201d\nMy sister blinked. Then her yellowy eyes widened. \u201cHonorary nieces and nephews? Huh. I never considered it that way before. You\u2019re right: it seems a step too far for even me to devour family. Wait a moment. Let me see what yarn I can weave with that particular skein that might change your rhyme-scheme.\u201d\nShe reached into thin air and muttered something. A thick book simply fell into her hands.\nQuickly, she thumbed through the pages. \u201cNieces and nephews\u2026 nieces and nephews\u2026\u201d\nAfter a moment, she looked up and paused. \u201cAh, here we go. An wicked witch for a godmother or, in some retellings, an aunt. I could enchant a spindle to put them to sleep for a hundred years, until they\u2019re full-grown. If they\u2019re unconscious, they don\u2019t need to eat. You would just have to figure out how to make them each prick their finger on it in turn. Surely some would become wise to the trick after watching the first few fall into near-deathly slumber.\u201d\n\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t I have to fall asleep for a hundred years along with them? And wouldn\u2019t thorns sprout all around my shoe?\u201d I objected. That sounded like an extreme solution. Also, dangerously likely to result in punctures. Don\u2019t laugh, reader: do you know how much a cobbler\u2019s services cost when including travel expenses to leave their shop and patch a building-sized shoe? I already can\u2019t afford to feed the children as it is!\n\u201cHmmm, that\u2019s true. It would put a massive damper on the mahjong group if you were incapacitated for a hundred years. We might have to find a new fourth,\u201d Giselle conceded.\nI gasped in outrage. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare! Those are \n tiles!\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right. We can\u2019t weave that pattern then. Let\u2019s see if we can find something else more appropriate.\u201d Adjusting the wire-frame spectacles perched on the bridge of her pointy and generously be-warted nose, Giselle began to rifle through the book once more, pages whisking rapidly like moths\u2019 wings.\nAfter several moments, she looked up once more. \u201cI have rediscovered a classic. It\u2019s not a yarn in common usage and stretching the aunt relationship may ripple the weft slightly, but it might still do well enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m all ears,\u201d I exclaimed, stretching out my hands imploringly. \u201cPlease, anything is better than the pattern we\u2019re currently working with!\u201d\n\u201cAre any of your foundlings particularly lazy?\u201d Giselle inquired with careful precision.\nContemptuously, I snorted. \u201cA baker\u2019s dozen. Take your pick.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, Bertha. I\u2019m trying to behave here. Are any of the lazy ones also adolescent girls who know how to spin?\u201d\n. I thought hard for a moment. Spinning wasn\u2019t generally a part of our everyday lives. \u201cI\u2019m reasonably sure Ella knows how to spin. She\u2019s sixteen years old, give or take a year, and she\u2019s one of the laziest of the lot.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Giselle slammed the weighty tome shut and tossed it casually into midair, where it disappeared once more, without hitting the ground. \u201cGo home and tell her that her name is now \u2018Sarah.\u2019\u201d\nI blinked. \u201cWait, what?\u201d \nWithout responding to the interruption, Giselle continued, \u201cNext, in a few days, beat her for her constant laziness.\u201d\nEven as I opened my mouth to object, she barked, \u201cAll right! I don\u2019t believe you \n have to beat her! Just reprimand her loudly and threaten to beat her. Since you claimed her to me as an honorary child a few minutes ago, you should be close enough to being her mother to warp the pattern in the correct direction. I hope.\u201d Rolling her eyes, she muttered, \u201cFaint-hearted softie,\u201d under her breath. I didn\u2019t think she was referring to Ella\u2026\n.\n\u201cAs soon you do that, a queen should stop by your house\u2026 I mean, shoe\u2026 Now, this part is important: whatever you do, do \n tell the queen that Sarah is lazy. Instead, you must tell her that Sarah is such a good spinner that you can\u2019t buy enough flax to keep her busy. In fact, that\u2019s why you\u2019re so poor that you live in a shoe. Because you spent all your money on flax.\u201d\n \u201cYou want me to lie to royalty?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cThat sort of behavior results people being cursed or beheaded! What if the queen ends up being a wicked queen?\u201d \n\u201cHow badly do you need food and wealth again? No risk, no reward. If you cling closely enough to the archetype, you should be safe. If this all works out correctly, the queen will take Sarah back to her castle and offer to marry Sarah to the prince if she can spin an entire room full of flax within three days.\u201d\n\u201cBut Sarah can\u2019t spin an entire room full of flax in three days!\u201d I protested.\n\u201cOf course she can\u2019t! That\u2019s precisely the point. During the third night, when she\u2019s on the verge of failure, three women will show up in the room and offer to help her as long as she calls them her aunts and invites them to her wedding to the prince. One will have a deformed foot, one will have a massive thumb, and one will have a fat lip.\u201d She gestured to her own face. \u201cI\u2019ll recruit two of my coven sisters and we\u2019ll cheat a little by using magic to spin for her. If this tale-weaving holds, we\u2019ll enjoy a high quality, free dinner paid for by the queen\u2019s coin (hopefully with steak), Sarah will marry a prince and never have to spin again, and you can demand a steady income from Sarah and her rich husband to feed her siblings. I just hope that no pies sing at the wedding banquet.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t you get in trouble for helping us out like this? After all, you are supposed to be a wicked witch.\u201d\nGiselle shrugged. \u201cWitches are still allowed to have families, even honorary ones. A witch tended and cherished Rapunzel for a time, after all. Once you claimed your brats as family rather than potential food, you made it possible for me to temporarily circumvent the rules that govern me. I\u2019ll go eat a few extra children lost in the woods, or pinch one of the baker\u2019s tender little morsels, and I\u2019ll be safely wicked again soon enough.\u201d\nAnd, so, we lived happily ever after. Until a little man with an extraordinarily long name fleeing another tale deposited his unwanted offspring on the threshold of my shoe\u2026\u00a0"}

He couldn\u2019t afford one mistake.\nBut this chef blocked his passage and would not let him on his way\n\u2018til the brave little lad challenged him to a cook-off on this day.\nThe brave little lad was at an impasse with this chef,\nso agreeing to his demands was the only choice he had left.\nThe brave little lad was not a talented cook, he knew.\nSo what could he prepare that could help him see this through?\n\u2018Twas a frightening proposition the young lad face ahead,\nso he thought hard on a dish that may yet keep him not dead.\nWhile the young lad was no chef, there were some dishes that he knew,\nHis mother taught him cooking, such as how to brew a simple stew.\nHe thought for a while of all the dishes he could make,\nbut none seemed right to protect him from his proposed dark fate.\nBut since leaving on this journey, he had stayed in some friendly villages.\nDifferent people taught him new things. Perhaps he could use one of these dishes?\nA decent plethora of knowledge he had been obtaining along the way.\nBut could that help him at this moment? It was rather tough to say.\nThe lad checked his pack, and through his ingredients, he perused.\nHe hoped something in there he would think of how to use.\nAs the carnivorous orcish chef rushed the young lad to pick a course.\nFrom within his bag, he drew two fish he had collected from a port.\n\u201cThey call it the Galerka fish,\u201d the young lad held them out.\n\u201cThese shall be our dish!\u201d The fish were portly and stout.\nThe Galerka fish has several small spikes in a row along its sides,\nthey could withdraw and protrude through these holes that look like eyes.\nAs the orcish chef gutted it, he saw the spikes met with the meat,\nbut he snapped \u2018em free with ease. He didn\u2019t miss a beat.\nThe young lad removed them with much more care and ease.\nHe slid his blade in and detached the spikes. He made it look like a breeze.\nO\u2019er the flames of the grill, they cooked their bizarre fish,\nThe aroma was unusual; it was a salty, smelly dish.\nThe orcish chef\u2019s flames climbed high up in the air,\nif they burned him, he did not notice; neither did he care.\nBut the brave lad\u2019s flames were much, much lower,\nbut do you think that this cooked the fish any slower?\nAs the smoke climbed up the chimney, it drew the attention of the wildlife.\nTheir fish were cooked so tender they would cut without a knife.\nSo they plated their fish dishes, and they cared little for presentation.\nThis is all about taste and texture; no need for physical persuasion.\nFirst, they ate the lad\u2019s fish, and it was salty as the sea,\n\u201c\nsaid the Orc chef, \nThe orc ate down his own fish, and the lad just stood aside.\nthe orc said with evident pride.\nBut you see what the lad knew that the orcish chef did not,\nGalerka fish venom was deadly. That\u2019s why few of these fish were caught.\nWell, that is to say, the females are. Their venom poisons their meat.\nThe male meat is safe. One must know which fish is safe to eat.\nThe lad had cooked the male.

He felt bad that he gave him poisoned meat.\n\u201cI am sorry that you are dead now, and I don\u2019t think you were evil.\nBut you must understand it is unkind to eat people.\nI must tell you, sir, your self-praise was no tease.\nYou did, in fact, make the most delicious grilled cheese.\u201d"}
{"title": "The Poison Tree", "story": "Trees are wondrous things, from their strong trunks to their delicate leaves. They feed from the sun and feel its warm rays far longer than we humans do, pausing under their broad branches, perhaps to shelter from the rain; perhaps to listen to the rustling of the leaves, another language, just as expressive as our own. Sometimes we try to capture what the tree means to us in words; such things as \n, perhaps your dad has told you that; or \n is a favourite of your mum\u2019s. Enchanting words, plucked from those enchanting trees.\nBut this story is about a different sort of tree; one whose fruit you should not pick and certainly not eat, however tempting it looks. This tree grows within the pages of fairy tale; it grew from a seed which should never have been sown, let alone been permitted to prosper: the seed of envy.\nThis story begins long ago and far away and this is how it starts: there was a beautiful girl, an envious queen and a rosy apple, poisoned to the core. And who had poisoned it? Well the jealous old queen of course. Tricking the girl with the luscious looking fruit, one bite was all it took for death to deal its blow. The lovely maiden was sealed in a glass casket where all could wonder at her eternal beauty; for although days and weeks then months and years passed, the young woman remained seemingly asleep while others stooped, greyed and passed away.\nThe queen thought she had had her cake, and eaten it too; still, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from walking past the glass casket. Weekly, then daily, then twice a day: she would stop by and slowly a terrible realisation dawned on her: death had stolen none of the young maiden\u2019s beauty; the only one robbed was her, of any sense of satisfaction.\nEnvy was like a worm burrowing silently, deep into a fruit. The worm of envy had eaten right to the core of the queen; its canker lived and flourished in her very heart. Yes, she had tricked the lovely young woman into taking the apple, had rejoiced when she bit, fell and was entombed. Her plan had worked but the beautiful girl had, nevertheless, cheated her of victory\u2019s sweet taste; for although she breathed no more, the queen had not vanquished her beauty. No, it lived on, undefeated, in her smooth unlined skin and shining hair.\u00a0\nIn her palace, the queen glanced into her beloved gilded mirror. In the past she had spied on the lovely young woman, sickened by her blossoming beauty which had surpassed her own. Now it was beloved no longer because its reflection reminded her of the maiden\u2019s ultimate victory: she had cheated age and was a vision of youth eternal; while she, the worker-of-wonders, was powerless to halt the march of time across her face.\nDeep within her the worm twisted, tying all her initial joy into knots. When she could bear it no longer, she plotted a second time. Creeping into the maiden\u2019s house, she crawled on hands and knees across the carefully swept floor, until she found the apple, still perfectly preserved in its poisoned loveliness despite its one missing bite. Hiding it in the folds of her cloak, she slipped home to the palace garden.\nClearing brambles and nettles, hefting the spade herself, she dug a hole and buried the fruit- not to rid herself of the poisoned fruit, or the memory of her terrible actions- no, as she planted the fruit deep in the earth, she muttered a spell:\n\u00a0\nShovelling the soil, she imagined the young woman losing not just her life, but beauty\u2019s power finally weakening before losing its hold.\nEvery day, morning and night, rain or shine, the queen would hurry out to her garden. Standing over the soil, she would weep tears of envy, rage, but also hope: that her monstrous plan might bear fruit and succeed. And, slowly, more than the rain, more than the sun, the water from her eyes woke the apple\u2019s seeds, for, like the queen, they had been waiting for the chance to work some fresh evil.\nWhen the first shoot broke the soil, she wept tears of elation. The shoot strengthened into a sapling, grew thicker, hardier, branches casting shade; and one monumental spring day the apple tree, with its ebony bark, bore blossoms as white as snow. The queen had long since dried her tears, now she smiled a thin smile to see the blossoms tremble and tumble from the boughs; in their place, apples as red as blood. Her plan was bearing fruit; time would bring the harvest.\nA prince from a neighbouring land rode by and was captivated by the maiden, so lovely even in death. Summoning his royal powers, he asked for the casket to be opened, which of course it duly was. With a jolt they raised they lid and the piece of apple, never swallowed, dislodged and the sleeper woke from her death-like slumber.\nThe queen rejoiced. She herself could hardly believe it, but she rubbed her hands and threw her head back, howling with delight. Here was her chance to do the job properly; this time beauty, along with life, would surrender to her magic powers.\nEven news of a royal wedding in the neighbouring land could not dampen her bliss, and when a footman dressed in green velvet knocked at her door, delivering her invitation to the couple\u2019s wedding, she smiled with awful pleasure.\nHurriedly she penned a reply:\nShe closed the door, picked up a basket, and went into her garden. The queen knew that revenge is a dish best served cold, even if her envy had been simmering ever since the girl had thwarted her first plan. As she plucked apple after apple from the tree, placing them carefully in her basket, she considered which dish would best deliver the revenge she had in mind; but from apple pie to crisp, no recipe seemed just right.\nShe rested the heavy basket on her kitchen table and picked up the paring knife: splitting the fruits, gouging out cores, wresting the pips from their snug beds, cutting slice after slice, white flesh rimmed with a deep blood red.\nAs she worked, she looked in her mirror, propped against her pots of spice: dried onion, powdered tears; and chilli: flakes to raise a fever. \n She crooned to herself. Her cold eyes stared back at her and inspiration struck: a tarte tatin it would be, that most lovely of apple puddings would be her foe\u2019s downfall: her just desserts.\nCarefully she placed the slices, arranging them in spirals before making the sauce: melting the sugar, cubing the butter, stirring until it oozed from the wooden spoon when she lifted it like threads of sticky honey. Finally, she brushed the apples, crowning the dish with its pastry hat, before popping it into the oven. Forty-five minutes to wait: after the long years of watching her rival triumph, in death as much as life, it was no time at all.\nWhen it was bronzed and the kitchen was filled with the glorious scent of home baking, the queen turned the tarte onto its crystal platter, noting with satisfaction that the apples had darkened to amber: the poison to trap her fly. The sugars had seeped out a little and she had to resist the temptation to lick her fingers as she carried the sticky confection to the door.\nThe wedding feast was due to be celebrated the next day, but the Queen was not prepared to leave her plan a moment longer, summoning her coachman to bring her carriage immediately. Four beautiful black horses were harnessed, the carriage drew up to her door and the queen stepped lightly inside, resting her wedding gift- the lustrous dessert- on the crimson seat beside her. The coachman flicked his whip and the steeds sprang to a gallop. The queen settled herself back against the sumptuous cushions; the wheels of her plot were turning and she couldn\u2019t have been happier.\nFrom the carriage window she saw the palace come into sight. She had been expecting turrets and towers, imagining the lady would demand a home as lovely as herself. The reality was a surprise: her foe\u2019s residence was more a house than a palace; it didn\u2019t dominate the land, if anything it looked small- almost ordinary. The carriage drew to a halt, the door was opened and the queen almost forgot to pick up her terrible tarte in her shock and confusion. Steadying herself at the steps, she carefully alighted and made her way to the front door, cradling the dish carefully in the snug of her arm.\nBefore she had a chance to knock, the door was opened and the lovely young maiden- her foe- stood in the entrance, wearing an apron and a smile. The queen took two steps back in surprise but the bride seemed unphased, moving forward and taking the tarte from the visitor before it was even offered.\n\u201cSo kind,\u201d smiled the wife-to-be, \u201cthe footman gave me your reply, and how lucky that I just love apples.\u201d\n\u201cA pleasure, my dear,\u201d managed the queen, unsettled by the bride\u2019s appearance: crumpled clothes, smudges on her cheeks from cooking, and was that a grey hair glistening in her ebony locks?\nThe woman noticed her puzzled stare but only laughed.\n\u201cOh, you must excuse my appearance: I\u2019m helping with the wedding feast, and since I woke from that long sleep, time seems to have been catching up with me a bit- busy working woman and all that!\u201d\nShe took the queen\u2019s elbow and guided her into the kitchen which was a busy chaos of platters and pots, tureens and tumblers. The bride cleared a space for the dessert and pulled two champagne flutes towards her.\n\u201cWe must have a drink, a toast before tomorrow: we are neighbours now after all!\u201d\nThe queen demurred: \u201cOh no, my dear, I\u2019ve reached an age where I can\u2019t touch a drop.\u201d\nThe bride uncorked a green bottle and a scent, strangely familiar, filled the air.\n\u201cWell this can be drunk entirely guilt free: water, fruit and nothing else. I promise.\u201d She said coyly. \u201cJust a little taste now, on the eve of my special day.\u201d\nShe pressed a glass into the queen\u2019s protesting hands and took one herself. And somehow the queen couldn\u2019t stop herself from raising it to her lips; like an invisible hand was lifting the glass too, and the queen was compelled to drink to the toast:\n\u201c\n\u201d\nThe queen had to swallow the sweet drink, managing to gasp fitfully through the bubbles: \u201cbut-how?\u201d\n\u201cHow did I know about your plan? Well I took the trouble of getting a mirror of my own; you could say that I learned from experience to keep both eyes peeled for trouble.\u201d\nAnd she crossed to a mirror, gilded and oddly familiar, which reflected a kitchen the queen knew all too well, for it was her own.\n\u201cWhen I saw you making your dessert and casting your spell, I thought it might be time to pay a visit to your tree and work a little magic of my own. I hope you don\u2019t mind; there were so many apples, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d miss a few.\u201d\nThe queen couldn\u2019t answer as the drink was working its magic. Deep inside, the worm of envy, which had burrowed so deep- a parasite within her so long- was writhing in agony. In its death throes it lashed and squirmed until, finally, it ruled over her no longer and was gone; finally, she was free. Standing before her now was a foe no longer, simply a woman- a neighbour- with wise words to impart:\n\u201cBut perhaps, on reflection, it might be best if we both got rid of our mirrors, staring into them too much can be a damaging past-time, at any age!\u201d\nThe queen looked at the bride with her crumpled clothes, smudged cheeks and one grey hair, recognising her for what she was: a fellow woman and a sister to embrace.\nShe crossed to the rubbish bin and tipped her tarte inside. Then she smiled, refilling both their glasses, and raised hers to the lovely bride.\n\u201cA toast to friendship: the most beautiful thing of all.\u201d"}

Complete terror overtook Mike. He had locked his bedroom door, and stood so quiet that the only sound he made was the uncontrollable thump of his heart beating. Somehow through the ruckus he tried to decipher what was happening in his small apartment.\n\tFrom what he could hear the front door had opened, and frantic footsteps traveled toward what seemed to be his bathroom. What followed next was pained retching, dry heaving, and a toilet flushing. If this was someone coming to steal from him, they were having a rough go at it. Besides, this \u201cstranger\u201d knew exactly where Mike\u2019s bathroom was. It had to be someone he knew.\n\tSlowly Mike creaked open the bedroom door, and called out.\n\t\u201cHello?\u201d\n\tThere was no reply, only the sounds of echoed retching, and heavy breathing. Unsure of what to expect. Still unsure of who was in his home Mike prepared himself for whatever would come next.\n\tCautiously, Mike creaked open the door to peer into the hallway. The bathroom light was on, and someone was definitely in there. At first Mike wondered if a stranger just really needed to use the bathroom, but unless he had forgotten to lock the front door it would have to be one of the three people who had a key. Mike had thought of the first person to come to mind who would be bold enough to invade his bathroom the way that they had.\n\t\u201cDill Pickle?\u201d And as if saying the pet name willed him into existence, there he was. Mike\u2019s Boyfriend Dylan.

He must\u2019ve just gotten off work. He was still clad in his paramedic uniform.\n\t\u201cI think I\u2019ll need a stronger dose.\u201d Dylan spoke as if Mike knew what he was talking about, but Mike didn\u2019t know that vomiting was a normal occurrence in his lover\u2019s life.\n\t\u201cDose of what? Do you need me to run to Rite-aid?\u201d Mike continued rubbing Dylan's back.\n\t\u201cNo, I have to talk to my doctor again. My stomach ulcers seem like they\u2019re getting \tworse. I used to have them when I was young, but they weren\u2019t like this.\u201d Mike finally had a chance to speak after being forced to pray to the porcelain gods for the past few minutes.\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t think work stress is causing it?\u201d Mike was finally able to look into Dylan\u2019s eyes and only see shame as if he had failed himself.\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I just have a few more shifts this week, and I\u2019ll get my day off.\u201d\n\tDylan tried to assure Mike that he was okay, but Mike wasn\u2019t buying it. The man\u2019s eyes were heavy, and the fatigue that Dylan was feeling was palpable in the air.\n\t\u201cDill, you can\u2019t keep on going like this, there\u2019s no reason to.\u201d Mike tried his best to console Dylan, but the man nudged him away and went back to puking into the toilet. Once Dylan was finished he took a breath, and spoke as if he just ran a sprint.\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t get better if I don\u2019t improve. And I don\u2019t want to mess up like \n again.\u201d Mike had felt that the worst of his episode was over so he allowed himself to sit on the floor with his back on the wall.\n\t\u201cMistakes happen Dill, and that was literally your first day.\u201d Mike went to grab him a towel. The night after Dylan's first day was still fresh in his mind. It was the first time since being together that he had seen the rock in his life shed tears. But against the crashing waves of the sea all rocks can crack, and erode against its strength.\n\t\u201cMistakes happen?\u201d Dylan shook his head \u201cThat guy died because of my mistakes. And on top of that I almost killed Mia.\u201d Mike had remembered talking to Dylan\u2019s coworker Mia on more than one occasion about how self critical Dylan could be while at work, and Mike had done all he could to try and ease his mind when mistakes like that happen. But when someone\u2019s life is on the line, it's hard to dismiss the value of mistakes. Every second mattered when it was someone's life was in your hands, and mistakes shortened that time.\n\t\u201cAnd when\u2019s the last time you took a risk like that when you\u2019re driving?\u201d Dylan was quiet for a moment before looking back at Mike, and shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you don\u2019t do that shit anymore. And in a funny way because that guy died, he ended up saving just as many people as you have.\u201d\n\tDylan just shook his head. \u201cBut how long will it be before my Ulcers makes me fuck up? If they find out how bad it gets, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m too weak to work, and they mi-\u201c and like a surge of inspiration Dylan went from sitting to back on his knees, over the toilet, dry heaving, and in pain.\n\t\u201cYou need water Dill!\u201d Mike darted quickly into the kitchen and came back with a cup of water. Mike set it beside Dylan while he finished leaning on the toilet bowl, and took a sip afterward.\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be better after this week I swear.\u201d Dylan tried to reassure him, but Mike only\tshook his head.\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll never be content this way\u2026 There\u2019s nothing you can do about it now except learn from it.\u201d Dylan\u2019s vomiting had finally subsided enough to where he could think about what Mike was saying to him. He took a sip of the water Mike had brought, and spoke.\n\t\u201cPeople need me. And I just can\u2019t let them down.\u201d\n\t\u201cAnd I need you too, but for different reasons. I just want you to be okay, and get home safe and healthy. You aren\u2019t weak or less of a man because you need the day off sometimes. Your body is telling you to take it easy, and you\u2019re ignoring it.\u201d The two were silent for a while, partially to wait out and see if Dylan\u2019s stomach had anything else left to say, and partially for Dylan to contemplate his lover\u2019s words. Finally Dylan spoke.\n\t\u201cSorry for barging in and ruining your night Mikey\u2026\u201d Dylan\u2019s eyes held dark circles over them. But Mike just scoffed at his apology.\n\t\u201cOne of the best people in my life came over, had a deep chat with me, and\u2019ll cuddle me tonight. I\u2019m actually kinda happy you got sick.\u201d\n\tThe two men chuckled and a wave of ease fell over the both of them. Dylan was still a bit weak, but luckily Mike had some medicine hidden away that would settle his stomach down for the night, and after a while the night found its peace once more, and Dylan with Mike\u2019s help was ushered to bed with a bucket in his free hand just in case."}
{"title": "Insanely Fine Cuisine", "story": "Warning: a bit of gore and violence\nDuncan Dupree, head chef of La Vie Le Calamar, drummed his fat fingers on his crossed upper arms and surveyed the chefs in training as they prepared Le Grande Repas Quatro, the feast for that evening.\u00a0His snooty nose in the air, his little piggy eyes lasered onto Pierre as the young man added a dollop of truffle oil to his risotto.\nDupree waddled over to the gently bubbling pot and inhaled the steam, dramatically closing his eyes and wafting the steam towards him with one hand, the other hand at the end of a limp wrist.\u00a0\nI thought, \u2018\n.\u2019 The cool young man ignored the fat chef and even had the audacity to smile.\nHis smile was beautific too, like Mona Lisa watching the \u2018Soup Nazi\u2019 episode of Seinfeld.\u00a0How I admired him.\u00a0He was tall, my height, with dark cropped GQ hair and blue eyes so dark, they made sapphires jealous.\u00a0He was thin, with broad shoulders, and favored the slim-fitting men\u2019s fashions of Italy- snug, muscle-hugging, yet soft and sleek and sometimes shiny.\u00a0I, on the other hand, come from old Scottish farming stock, red of hair, freckled of face, and somewhat thick boned.\u00a0I was not jealous of Pierre, and don\u2019t get me wrong, I was not in love with him either, but instead, I used him as inspiration to get back to the gym.\nDupree on the other hand, either was extremely jealous of him\u2026 or madly infatuated.\u00a0Or perhaps he\u2019d been bullied as a child, and now took out his revenge upon us students.\nThis was a very expensive culinary academy.\u00a0They taught only four students at a time.\u00a0The owner of the academy was the multi-billionaire foodie, Malcome Crackett the Third, who also owned the magazine \u2018Trip and Tip\u2019 that I wrote articles for.\u00a0The writing was my first professional gig; I aspired to write novels, but did enjoy the travel and tasting and reviewing, my name was getting out there.\u00a0At last, next month, I was scheduled for my first European series of reviews.\u00a0I was at La Vie Le Calamar on\u2026I suppose you could say, a scholarship, Crackett liked my work so far and had injected my name into the roster for this semester.\nWe were into the final week (five days, actually) and I, along with three other students, Dupree, and a guest- sometimes a movie star, sometimes a political star, sometimes Crackett himself- feasted on each of the five nights on meals we created in the immense modern steel kitchen of the academy.\u00a0Each morning of the final five days, Dupree handed out the assignments; each of the five days, us five- students and head chef- were tasked with one of the five categories: Entr\u00e9e, starch side, vegetable side, soup, or salad. Salad did desert as well.\u00a0Each of us made one of these in accordance with whomever was tasked with the entr\u00e9e.\u00a0When the meal was eaten, the cameras stopped rolling.\nDupree was the quintessential jilted one from a Gerry Springer, the crier of a black mother whose murderous, drug dealing gangster son was killed by cops. He was drama personified.\nThe preparing was all filmed for the hit foodie tv show on HBO of the same name as the academy, Dupree\u2019s bullying was essential for the show\u2019s success, he was the man you loved to hate.\u00a0He threw things.\u00a0He ranted and raved.\u00a0He bullied\u2026and the audience ate it up (pun intended.)\nAs I watched from the corner of my eye, Pierre nodded slightly.\u00a0He was bracing himself.\u00a0The other two students in the kitchen, Vera, the only woman in our class, and Charlie, the burly, bearded Canadian, tried not to quiver, but did anyways, fearful of Duncan\u2019s rants and raves.\u00a0\nNot to disappoint the audience, Dupree, after inhaling the steam I caught whiffs of from across the steel prep table in the center, dramatically flailed his fat white hands in the air and bellowed, \u201cWrong! All wrong!\u00a0Where is the \n!\u00a0Where is the earthy scent dat de connoisseurs want?!\u00a0Gah!\u00a0Start over!\u201d\u00a0He grabbed a wooden spoon in the rest on my side of the table and threw it at Pierre.\u00a0Then he dumped the risotto, pot and all, into the trash bin.\nMy mouth had watered as the risotto steam met my nose.\u00a0It had been perfect.\nPierre smiled that smile, and silently bowed towards the fat man who turned his back on him with a \u201cHarumph\u201d and acted as though Pierre were kowtowing, but I knew different.\u00a0I saw the young man\u2019s eyes.\u00a0They flashed red, like a warning.\u00a0He grinned and his canines grew as I watched, saliva strung thinly down his chin.\u00a0He lunged at the fat man and sunk his teeth into the fat roll of his neck.\u00a0Wet red blood spewed like a geyser!\u00a0I gasped, ducked, and covered my face before the shower flooded over me.\nDupree said, \u201cMichael Magilicutty!\u00a0C\u2019est quoi ce bordel!\u00a0You got de bee in ya noggin boy?\u00a0Mind that souffl\u00e9 or it will fall.\u201d\nI looked up.\u00a0No blood, no fangs.\u00a0I realized that I did have a bee in my noggin.\u00a0I stifled an insane titter.\u00a0\nDupree then set his sights on Vera, a petite Vietnamese woman with deer-in-headlights eyes behind thick glasses.\u00a0She was assigned lamb for the entre that night and had chosen a braised recipe with Morroccan spices.\u00a0Vera cringed under the bully-chef\u2019s piggy gaze, and I lost respect for her.\u00a0\nDupree inspected the rack and tasted the marinade.\u00a0He slammed his hand onto the table \u2018WHAM!\u2019 and Poor Vera jumped, as did I and the Canadian that looked like a lumberjack.\u00a0Only Pierre kept his calm as he prepared a new pot of boiling chicken stock.\u00a0\u201cThis is fine,\u201d Dupree said with a hint of \u2018meh,\u2019 \u201cNeeds some zing\u2026 some pow.\u201d\u00a0He slammed the table again.\nI dared a peek into my oven.\u00a0I swear that ass was trying to collapse my artichoke souffle.\u00a0I felt those nasty little eyes on my back and chided myself for letting him get to me.\u00a0I busied myself with my lemon aioli sauce.\nBehind me Charlie, the Canuck, sighed audibly as Dupree passed him by.\nThat night, Jennifer Judson was our guest star, there to promote her new talk show.\u00a0Naturally, Dupree bent over backwards to kiss her black ass; Vera and Charlie were star struck, Pierre was visibly amused by her advances towards him off camera, and I was glad to see the egocentric twat flustered though Dupree would make Pierre pay.\nShe sat at one end of the table, Dupree, at the other.\u00a0Vera sat across from me next to Pierre.\u00a0Dupree acted the proud momma hen, Charlie was his funny self, Judson talked about herself and her show.\u00a0The meal was delicious, though the risotto was too earthy, and damn that Dupree if he didn\u2019t belittle Pierre\u2019s culinary talents.\u00a0\n\u201cI warned you the truffle oil was potent.\u201d Dupree waggled a finger at Pierre.\nPierre said, \u201cAh.\u00a0Aren\u2019t certain breeds of ovine the truffle experts?\u201d\u00a0He didn\u2019t look up from his forkful.\nJudson laughed like a braying mule.\nThe rest of us looked stunned as Dupree\u2019s entire head turned into a tomato.\u00a0He recovered quickly and said, \u201cOui. Why yes, in the Basque territory of France, leetle piglets of the rare Gascon family are trained to sniff the delicacies out.\u00a0As a leetle boy I often accompanied mon pere with our prize piggies\u2026\u201d\nPierre, who actually did come from France, put down his fork and said, \u201cBut Chef Dupree, is it not fact you grew up in the Bronx?\u201d\nDupree stood, sprightly for such a large man, plucked the carving knife from the table and hurled it at Pierre like a spangled professional at the circus.\u00a0Pierre caught the knife by the blade, leapt upon the table like a cat, crouched, then sprung at Dupree.\u00a0Blood from his hand rained down, turning the white tablecloth into a gory rorschach test as he charged.\u00a0\nBoth women screamed, Vera fainted, Charlie turned, and discreetly vomited under the table.\nDupree quivered with fright and fury, his fists balled as if he was going to punch the feral young man.\u00a0Pierre plunged the knife into the top of the man\u2019s head to its hilt.\u00a0Dupree feebly punched left and right like a windup toy monkey winding down.\u00a0Blood teared from his eyes, spurted from his nose, and gushed from his open mouth as he gargled a scream.\u00a0\n\u201cMicheal.\u201d\nI spun to the left to see who had spoken, but to my left, Judson stared at me curiously.\u00a0I looked back to Dupree and realized I had stood up.\u00a0He was not bloody.\u00a0He had that smarmy look on his face.\u00a0Pierre was just digging into his creamy Rhubarb Vanilla mousse.\u00a0I sat and Dupree made a circular motion by his left ear.\u00a0\u201cBuzzing bees in dere.\u201d\nI sat down and faked a laugh.\u00a0I thought to myself, \nI zoned back to the dinner party, but my mind was on the issue that had sent my wife packing a month ago.\n\u201c\u2026ook?\u201d\nCharlie had been talking to me.\u00a0I looked up.\u00a0He had green lumpy vomit, like pea soup, down his front.\u00a0When I blinked it was gone.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u00a0What were you asking?\u201d\n\u201cWonderin how your book is coming.\u00a0Its nearly done, eh?\u201d\n\u201cHeh heh.\u00a0Well, it\u2019s been on hold the last couple of weeks.\u201d\u00a0I gestured at the table, now devoid of the meal but displaying near empty desert dishes.\nThe next day in the kitchen, on the air, Pierre, tasked with venison for the entr\u00e9e, announced it would be Bourguignon.\nDupree smiled smugly.\u00a0No one made Bourguignon as good as he\u2026and venison?\u00a0Unheard of.\u00a0\nI was tasked with the soup and felt a light bisque of some sort would be an ideal starter for the rich, sauce-laden entre.\u00a0Tomato-carrot with a drizzle of parsley pesto.\nI heard Janice\u2019s naggy voice in my head as I chopped my carrots with a deadly looking blade. \nnagging\nsane\nThe voice was chill, calm, \u2026patronizing.\nI wondered for a minute if she was right.\u00a0\u2018\n\u2019 The lie felt even worse in my head that it had out loud. I was lying to myself now.\u00a0\u2018\n.\u2019\u00a0That sounded better maybe.\n\u00a0Dupree was on the warpath.\u00a0We all could feel it in the air.\u00a0It was his last chance to humiliate Pierre once and for all.\u00a0He wanted a meltdown.\u00a0He wanted a resignation. I suspect he wanted, above all, a blowjob.\u00a0\nThough his exterior was calm, the air buzzed with his nefarious intentions. Then I realized that it was my head that was buzzing.\u00a0Those damned bees.\u00a0\u2018\n\u2019 I looked around.\u00a0No one was watching me.\u00a0I poured a half cup of cooking sherry into my water bottle, looked around again, and drank it down. The buzzing subsided.\nDupree was complimenting Vera on her choice of bitter endives for her salad, the bleu cheese crumbles and small dabs of bright red sundried tomato chutney was perfect.\u00a0I looked over and saw that the chutney was oozing over the table and plopping to the floor like bloody gore.\u00a0\nI blinked.\u00a0It was gone.\u00a0Vera was mixing the batter for her crepes suzette.\u00a0She\u2019d won back some of my respect, the Grand Marnier would double as an aperitif and her extra egg whites guaranteed a lighter crepe. She would make a fine chef one day.\nI wasn\u2019t so sure about Charlie. I just couldn\u2019t get the lumberjack image out of my head.\u00a0I looked over at him and saw he was chopping his broccoli with a wooden handled axe. \u2018Whump! Whump! Whump!\u2019 As Charlie scooped up the bite-sized florets, I saw a scattering of severed fingers on the table, their bloody stumps glistening red\u2026Dupree came over, surely to take the axe away and laugh at the funny joke.\u00a0The fat man blocked my view as he patted Charlie on one of his beefy, flannelled shoulders.\n\u201cVery gute Charlie.\u00a0Very creative to infuse a hint of Asia into a French meal.\u00a0Bite sized, I like that, we cut the meat, we don\u2019t need to cut the veggies too, no?\u201d Charlie was whisking together a miso-based marinade, his black mushrooms sitting by in a julienned pile.\nI drank some coffee quickly as Dupree turned my way, swirling the fumey beverage in my mouth. \u2018\n\u2019\n\u201cAh, Michael.\u00a0Very good choice for zee soup.\u00a0Light, cleansing ze palate.\u00a0Ah, and ze parlsey too, an obvious palate cleanser, not so subtle.\u201d\u00a0I wished he would STOP with the fake accent.\u00a0It made my head start to buzz again.\n\u201cShould I have used basil?\u201d\n\u201cTut tut dear boy, non. A chef goes with what he feels is right, his instinct. I would have chosen parsley as well.\u201d\nDupree was being \u2026nice.\u00a0Scary.\u00a0I feared for Pierre\u2026Who was humming as he sprinkled a pinch of fresh herbs into the aromatic dish Julia Child had made famous.\u00a0I was concerned. Dupree had given Pierre venison instead of beef because if not cooked just exactly right, it would be tough and, or, too gamey, stringy.\nBut the handsome Pierre was humming as if he were Peter Pan and had a pixie at his shoulder to magically make everything he made the most spectacular.\nAnd it was.\nDinner that night was the best of our five.\u00a0The entre was spectacular.\u00a0I had only eaten venison in sausage form and knew it to be gamey.\u00a0\u00a0But, like a good scotch, one embraces the character of the drink, whether oaky or smokey, in venison, a subtle hint of gamey is key.\u00a0Pierre perfected the dish.\u00a0It melted in the mouth but wasn\u2019t mushy.\u00a0The texture resembled rare filet mignon.\u00a0Seasoned perfectly, and wonderfully black peppery, his entre was unique and sure to be a hit at whatever restaurant he opened in the future.\nI was proud of him.\u00a0I swelled with joy.\u00a0He nonchalantly accepted the praise of our guest, Mr.Crackett himself, with his glass of cabernet raised.\u00a0He was radiant. His pale skin glowed, his sapphire eyes sparkled as he looked directly at me and licked his lower lip.\nMy head was buzzing again. \n And I congratulated myself for knowing better. \u2018\n.\u2019\nWe all looked to Dupree.\u00a0His opinion mattered little. The viewers voted, the guest\u2019s comments aided the viewers decisions.\u00a0How would the fat man deal with this young nemesis moving on to greatness?\nDupree, smiling and smarmy, cloyingly polite, apologized to the table and the cameras, as he got up and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid zere iz something wrong with ze meat.\u00a0I fear I am going to, uh, be ill.\u201d\nHe dramatically left the room, limp-wristed hand on his up-raised brow, the other on his chest.\n\u2018\n!\u2019 I thought.\u00a0Getting sick on major tv was the absolute worst, the paramount disgrace no aspiring chef could survive. \u2018\n\u2019\nEveryone was talking at the table, but their voices were buzzing in and out.\u00a0I held my head together with my hands, unsure of what was real, and what was my illness.\nWhen I looked up at the table, everyone sitting around it was grinning. Apparently, I\u2019d imagined the whole thing before\u2026including the eating, the entre in the center was still sitting under a silver dome.\nI looked around and sighed with relief, no buzzing.\u00a0Everyone looked normal.\u00a0No blood spurting from knife wounds, no bloody gore dripping to the floor.\nThe sides were passed around, I took the bowl of miso dressed broccoli from Charlie on my right and turned to pass it to the fat asshole on my left.\u00a0His seat was empty. I placed the bowl on the table and looked surreptitiously at each person sitting at the table.\u00a0They were chatting and talking with their hands and smiling.\u00a0\nI caught Pierre\u2019s eye from across the table.\u00a0He winked at me and grinned.\u00a0His canines were two inches long.\u00a0When the tongue that flicked out licked up his entire forehead and around to his chin, I shut my eyes and chanted, \nHe lifted the silver dome and, \u2018\n\u2019, there was Duncan Dupree\u2019s fat piggy head, roasted, perfectly charred on all the right edges, a sweet Honeycrisp apple in a mouth that was stretched far too wide.\u00a0The edges of it were split like the Joker\u2019s, and marrow-like goo drooled down the fat, roasted chin.\nReal or imaginary, I cared not at this point. I ran screaming from the room, not caring what they thought or what the cameras caught.\u00a0I ran home.\u00a0It was six miles.\u00a0I did not trust myself to drive. At my condo, I swallowed three of the pills and crawled underneath my bed with my cell phone.\u00a0I googled psychiatrists.\u00a0I texted my ex."}
{"title": "Are You All  Over the Meadow?", "story": "Teddy was out of sorts. This afternoon\u2019s visit with his cousins was not living up to expectations. Ruby, at six, was a year older and bossy. He no longer liked her silly game. Ruby had made it up and insisted they play it all afternoon. It seemed to Teddy to consist of nothing more than running about and never getting anywhere. He stood at the top of the lawn, which sloped in a smooth sweep of spongy turf to the road below, making angry dents in the soil with his toe. Ruby was calling out the signature line again.\n\u2018Are you all over the meadow?\u2019\n\u2018Yes.\u2019 He responded with little enthusiasm.\n\u2018Can I come with you?\u2019\n\u2018\n\u2019 Teddy roared his frustration.\n\u00a0That was the signal to run, and Teddy and Ruby raced away on diagonals across the sloping lawn, passing each other in the middle and looping around to the top where Ethel sat, her hands clamped over her eyes. Ethel\u2019s three-year-old legs had had enough, and she had decided to become invisible. It wasn\u2019t working, though, because Teddy marched straight up to her and pulled her hands away. \u2018You were s\u2019posed to run with us.\u2019\n\u2018I not,\u2019 declared Ethel.\n\u2018\n. That\u2019s the rules.\u2019\n\u2018I \n\u2019 Ethel\u2019s voice rose in defiance. Teddy scowled. His head bent suddenly over her hand, still held in his. Poor Ethel squealed in horror, her face crimson; he had \nher. She held the injured wrist up to show Ruby, who plopped down on the grass beside her and peered earnestly into her face, full of big sister concern. \u2018Whatever has happened Effie?\u2019\n\u2018Deddy bid me\u2019 Ethel huffed through her tears. \u2018Look Ruby, look. \nmarks.\u2019 Ruby looked. She glared at her cousin who stood with his arms folded firmly across his chest, pouting and unrepentant.\n\u2018Teddy, did you bite Ethel\n you?\u2019\n\u2018So what if I did,\u2019 said Teddy, \u2018she was cheating, so there.\u2019\n\u2018She\u2019s only three, Teddy. She doesn\u2019t understand the rules. You\u2019re very naughty to bite.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t care. You\u2019re not my mummy anyway. You\u2019re a big ninny.\u2019\nIncensed, Ruby did something that she was to regret, oh so much, afterwards. \u2018See how \n like it.\u2019 She grabbed Teddy\u2019s hand and raised it to her mouth. Before he could react she had closed her teeth, leaving bite marks on skin for the second time that day. Teddy roared in anger.\n\u2018I\u2019m going to tell Mummy on you. \nvewy\nnaughty, Wuby. You will be in big twouble now.\u2019 His face burned and angry tears glazed his eyelashes to points. Teddy always lost his r\u2019s when he got upset. He stumped off in righteous fury to find his mother.\n\u2018Why did Teddy bite you, Ethel?\u2019 said Henry, Teddy\u2019s older brother. Henry was nearly ten and considered himself far too mature to join in the younger children\u2019s game. He had spent the last hour sitting on the grass with a book in his hands. A thoughtful boy, he had quietly observed Teddy\u2019s rising anger.\nEthel was starting to enjoy the attention.\n din\u2019 do anyfing, Henry.\u2019 She cradled the sore hand against her tummy, unselfconsciously using her \u2018baby voice\u2019 to good effect. \u2018He jus\u2019 did it, jus\u2019 like dat.\u2019 She emphasised the point with a chopping motion of her good arm.\nRuby rose and offered a hand. \u2018Come on Effie, Daddy will be home soon. Let\u2019s go down to the gate and wait there. I bet I see him first.\u2019\n\u2018No\n will.\u2019 Tears forgotten, she bustled across the lawn with Ruby. Henry followed the girls, and it was Henry who saw his Uncle Walter first, striding down Arney Crescent with his jacket over his shoulder. Walter\u2019s law practice was handily situated in the nearby village of Remuera, and he loved walking home on a fine summer evening like this, down the hill past the many fine houses with the sea in his face. It gave him time to put aside the problems of the day and prepare to indulge in that most rewarding of pastimes, playing with his children. Now he swung Ethel onto his shoulders and took Ruby\u2019s hand, listening gravely as she explained in detail the rules and objectives of her new game.\nAs soon as she learnt to walk, Ruby would potter about the garden with Walter on the weekends, as he patiently explained what he was doing and why. 'See this little leaf here, you have to break it off very carefully, so the plant channels its energy into growing tomatoes instead of growing more stems and leaves. Yes you can try. Gently, Ruby, gently! Oh, see you've broken the whole stem now. Never mind, next time you'll get it right.' They would spend whole afternoons walking down to the wharf and fishing with a handline for sprats, walking back as the light faded and the sky blushed green and gold.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now, only half an hour later, Ruby hung her head and stared at the patterned red carpet in the big front room, twisting her hands in front of her. She bit her lip and tried to keep back the tears. Walter\u2019s ice-blue eyes, which normally radiated laughter, were troubled. \u2018Your aunt is very upset. Teddy says you bit him, Ruby, is this true?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ruby didn\u2019t look up. Daddy was so cross! She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing that look on his face, and she was devastated. \u2018Yes, Daddy,\u2019 she whispered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I am extremely disappointed in you, Ruby. I should have thought you would be more responsible. You will need to be punished for this.\u2019 Walter was a gentle man. He had never yet punished one of his children, but his sister\u2019s boy had a valid grievance, and she expected to see justice done. They had been brought up in an era when children were seen and not heard, when \u2018spare the rod and spoil the child\u2019 was considered sound parenting advice. Walter desperately wanted to be a good father and bring up responsible, considerate, and law-abiding children. His own parenting style was more about\u00a0mentoring than reward and punishment, and he knew his sister believed he was over-indulgent. His decision was strongly biased by that knowledge. \u2018I shall have to spank you, and then you must go to your room. You will have no dinner tonight.\u2019\nRuby lay in her bed upstairs and cried for a long time. She had never been spanked before and she felt the shame deeply. She had wanted to expose Teddy\u2019s behaviour to excuse her own but somehow the words she needed wouldn\u2019t come. She craved her Daddy\u2019s approval and she feared there was nothing she could say that would absolve her. So she endured the spanking and cried into her pillow.\nRuby\u2019s mother had planned a special meal but dinner at the big round table was unusually quiet. Teddy, fully aware of his guilt, was disconcerted by the severity of the sentence passed on Ruby. Henry\u00a0was contemplating injustice and whether he ought to speak up, while Walter\u2019s mind was haunted by Ruby\u2019s woebegone face. In the absence of her sister and in the strained atmosphere, Ethel was uncharacteristically subdued. Henry finally took advantage of yet another long silence.\n\u2018Uncle Walter?\u2019\n\u2018Yes Henry?\u2019\n\u2018Actually,\u2019 he said. Henry had recently discovered this word and used it whenever possible. \u2018Teddy bit Ethel first. And that\u2019s why Ruby bit \n.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Is that so? Thank you for telling me that, Henry. Did you bite Ethel, Teddy?\u2019\nTeddy, red faced, concentrated desperately on his plate. \u2018Yes.\u2019\nWalter regarded Teddy for a moment, his face expressionless. \u2018In that case, maybe the wrong child has been punished. I must visit the prisoner.\u2019\nRuby lifted a tear-stained face when Walter knocked.\n\u2018May I come in?\u2019 He looked around the door.\n\u2018Yes, Daddy.\u2019 Her voice was hoarse from crying.\n\u2018I\u2019m told that Teddy bit Ethel,\u2019 he said, sitting amiably on the bed. \u2018Is that\nwhat happened?\u2019\n\u2018Yes Daddy. He was so mean about it and I was so cross with him\u2026\u2019 Her lip wobbled.\n\u2018Oh sweetheart,\u2019 he gathered her into his arms. \u2018That was wrong, you know that don\u2019t you? Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\u2019 She nodded her head against his shirt front. \u2018But there is such a thing as a mitigating circumstance, and I shouldn\u2019t have punished you so harshly without asking more questions. I\u2019m very, very sorry. Ok?\u2019 More vigorous nodding. \u2018I am going to make a promise to you, Ruby. I promise I will never spank you again.\u2019\nAnd do you know what? He never did."}
{"title": "A Night Of Waking Dreams", "story": "\u201cI can see it now,\u201d She says nervously. Her big blue eyes stare over you, out the window. \u201cI can see the rain now. It wasn\u2019t raining before, was it?\u201d\nYou pretend to be asleep. Rise and fall. Rise and fall. You force yourself to take big, deep breaths, breaths like the ones Aria takes, the times she\u2019s fallen asleep faster than you. You let out a little sigh, a sleeping sigh, and pray it wasn\u2019t too dramatic.\nAria is sitting up. She had been asleep\u2014then the storm started. Probably woke up to the sound of the sky cracking in half and booming as it broke.\nNot literally, of course. But by the thundering growls outside, it sure sounded like it.\n\u2018Iris?\u2019 Aria\u2019s small hand taps your shoulder, \u2018Iris? Are you asleep?\u2019\nYou choose not to answer.\nYour eyes are closed, but you can still feel her eyes on you, in the way most sisters can. She\u2019s watching for a twitch of the eye, a flick of the wrist, a jerk of the leg.\nAnd you won\u2019t give it to her.\nThe thunder roars, past the yellow flowered curtains, lighting filling up the night sky like flying electric eels. Squinting your eyes the littlest bit, you see shadows dancing and twirling and waltzing on the bedroom wall. The room, and the world outside the window, looks eery and dark. The clouds cover the moon, but sometimes they shift to let its light through.\nThe soft glowing white rays illuminate the walls and the objects in the messy bedroom, filling places that shouldn\u2019t be filled with a sheet of ghostly white. The storm and the night work together to play tricks on your eyes, on your mind. You see a shape flick past you, to your right. Or maybe you don\u2019t. you hear a howling in the distance. Or maybe you don\u2019t. a hill to the west, not visible through the small window, but there nonetheless, would make a perfect place for howling at the moon. A perfect place for dangerous night things. A perfect place for fear.\nBut you\u2019re thirteen years old. Storms don\u2019t scare you. You\u2019ve studied them in school, studied their patterns and formations. And you\u2019ve lived on this farm all your life, lived near the hill to the west, and you have never seen a dangerous night thing.\nYet.\nA small hum comes from your side, light and high and worried. A siren. Or a little girl.\nYou remember Aria next to you. In truth, you never forgot. You feel her weight shift, as she lays back down, seemingly giving up on the thought of waking you.\nNot that she could. You like to consider yourself the best fake-sleeper there is. Seven years of sharing a bed with Aria does that to you.\nYou wait until you hear her breathing slow, hear her whimpers resolve. You turn slowly on your side, facing her, silently hoping she\u2019s really asleep. Or even in that land between sleep and waking, that land filled with tunnels of light and explosions of dreaming particles. You like that feeling, that feeling of being half-asleep, half-awake. You like feeling like time has frozen in place. You feel safe there, in that land, so close and yet so far away.\nYou hope Aria feels safe, there, too.\nHer little body is curled in on itself, frilled, clumped. She holds a small bundle\u2014a bundle of rags. A bundle called Rugs. A bundle called love.\nHer young, plump fingers squeeze the tighter and tighter and tighter. Unflinching. Clenching. Because it seems she\u2019s still awake. It seems she hears the thunder. Though her eyes are closed, she must see the bright flashes of lightning behind her lids.\nThat\u2019s alright. You used to worry that you subconsciously liked Aria best when she was sleeping. A strange worry, that was. You\u2019ve had a lot of strange worries.\nBut you know now, for sure, that even though you like sleeping Aria, you like awake Aria better. Normally. But maybe not now. Not an hour past midnight.\nShe looks so peaceful, even if she\u2019s only faking sleep.\nAnd then, the thunder cries louder than it has before. The ground seems to rumble the ceiling fan swings ever so slightly, casting a dancing shadow\u2014a large bird flying in the dim light.\nAria\u2019s eyes fly open. Her death grip on Rugs loosens and she reaches her small arm to you. She needs you.\n\u2018Iris,\u2019 her little voice\u2014the voice of a bumblebee, mother says\u2014calls to you.\n\u2018The storm,\u2019 she whinnies, a pony with pigtails, \u2018Rugs is scared.\u2019\nRugs is scared. Of course rugs is scared. Rugs is a bundle of rags. If you were a bundle of rags, you'd be scared, too.\nFine. Fine, she wants you awake. You had both been faking each other, in truth. And you both knew it, too. You weren\u2019t asleep, and neither was she.\n\u2018What, Ari?\u2019 your voice comes out more crackly than you thought it would, \u2018What can I do to help Rugs feel better?\u2019\nA roaring thunderous boom.\nAria sits bolt upright. Her hair is sticking up at all angles, and you would laugh, if she didn\u2019t look so terrified.\n\u2018Rugs wants a story. Can you tell him a story, Iris?\u2019 she says.\n\u2018Ari, its late. Later than late. I\u2019m not sure if a story\u2019s a good idea.\u2019\n\u2018Pleasssse,\u2019 she stretches out the word so long it sounds more like a moan.\n\u2018Oh, alright. One story. And then will Rugs stop pestering me and go to sleep?\u2019\nShe bobs her head full of straw-colored hair. Up and down. Up and down.\n\u2018Once upon a time,\u2019 you start, \u2018there lived two sisters. One of them, the older one, was called\u2026um\u2026Isabel. and the younger one was named\u2026Addy. And they were pirates. They lived on a boat called the Dangerous Night Thing, but they called it the DNT for short. Yeah. The DNT. Anyway, the two sisters were\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Princesses?\u2019\n\u2018Excuse me?\u2019\n\u2018They were princesses, right? Weren\u2019t they princesses, Iris?\u2019\n\u2018Uh\u2026well, I told you they were pirates. That\u2019s their thing.\u2019\n\u2018They can have two things, though. Can\u2019t they be pirate princesses?\u2019\n\u2018Pirate\u2014oh, fine. Let me keep going, though. These two pirate princesses sailed the seven seas with the DNT, and they fought sea monsters for a living. Not because they liked too, really, but because fighting sea monsters was a stable job with a good hourly pay. And this one night, they were fighting a big sea monster with tentacles. It was like a giant octopus, if a giant octopus was neon orange. And it had one eye. One big, glaring, blinking eye. And it could swallow a whole fishing boat with one gulp, a bit like how you ate your potato salad yesterday. But it couldn\u2019t eat the DNT, because the DNT was as big as it was. It would be like you, trying to eat a motorcycle. If you were the size of a motorcycle. But yeah. Isabella\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Isabel, Iris. Her name was Isabel.\u2019\nYou give Aria the stink eye. \u2018No,\u2019 you say, \u2018I\u2019m telling the story and I say her name was Isabel. But she went by Isabella, sometimes, too.\u2019\nShe shrugs. \u2018Keep going.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all there is to it. They were fighting a sea monster. In the DNT. And they were winning. The end.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s not a very good story.\u2019\n\u2018I know.\u2019\n\u2018Then make it better.\u2019\nYou cross your arms. \u2018How?\u2019\n\u2018Act it out.\u2019 Aria\u2019s little bottom lips pouts out. She seems to have forgotten about the storm outside. Good. You\u2019ll keep it that way.\n\u2018Alright. Lets say the bed is the boat. See that chair? That\u2019s a lifeboat. And the ceiling fan in a seagull.\u2019\nThe thunder clapped outside. Aria leaned closer to you.\n\u2018Rugs doesn\u2019t like the thunder, Iris,\u2019 she says softly.\n\u2018Well, tell Rugs that\u2019s not thunder. That\u2019s just the sea monster roaring as we so bravely vanquish it.\u2019\nAria\u2019s frown twists and flips until it runs into a grin.\n\u2018I can tell him that. So we\u2019re fighting it\u2014the sea monster\u2014right now?\u2019\n\u2018Yup. We\u2019re winning, too.\u2019\nAnd, looking out into the bedroom, you let yourself imagine. You haven\u2019t, in a long time, but you do now. The carpet dissolves into a black ocean. Your guitar in the corner tangles into a school of piranhas. There have to be piranhas. Obviously. Aria\u2019s soccer ball becomes the DNT\u2019s anchor, slowly sinking so that you can keep fighting the monster.\nOh, the monster. It roars and growls and hisses. It gets louder every few seconds, then dies down as you stab at it with your swords. Side by side, you and Aria take on a beast.\nBut the roaring gets louder. Louder than any living thing could get. And the carpet turns to carpet again, and the guitar and soccer ball become just that. And you and Aria find yourselves squatting on the bed together, facing a monster that never existed.\nA powerful crash of thunder.\n\u2018Iris?\u2019 Aria\u2019s bumblebee voice squeaks, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be on the boat anymore. Rugs is scared. Tell me another story.\u2019\nAnd you do. Because you want to feel that feeling again\u2014that feeling you get when you imagine, and everything dissolves into something better. You want to feel alive.\nThis time, the story starts in a jungle.\n\u2018Not just a jungle, a jungle cave. Two super smart and brave scientist ladies are there together, studying the rare one-footed dart frog. The frog lives on trees but will squirt poison at your through its eyes if it sees you. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re hiding in the cave. And in this jungle, it never rains or thunders. Ever. Never ever.\u2019\n\u2018But Iris,\u2019 Aria interrupts, \u2018How are there trees if it never rains?\u2019\nSo smart, that one.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 You say quickly, \u2018The trees get their water from an underground river. Like a aquifer.\u2019\nTake that big word, Aria. You\u2019re smart, too. Aquifer. Ha.\n\u2018Where\u2019s the cave for us?\u2019 she asks.\n\u2018Under the bed, of course. Ready to go?\u2019\nAnd together you crawl under the bed. Its warm and stuffy, and its cramped (because you seem to have grown since the last time you were there), but a jungle cave is warm and stuffy and cramped, too.\n\u2018That pile of clothes? That\u2019s a rare berry bush. Called the shadow berry. The lamp it the tree we\u2019re watching. And that stain on the lamp, from when I spilled my chocolate milk, is the one-footed frog. It looks asleep, but its only faking.\u2019\nAria stares at the frog with an intensiveness you match. You can hear the tropical birds calling to each other from high above.\nAnd then you hear a scratching sound. Like a fingernail against a blackboard. But it\u2019s not, obviously. No, it\u2019s the big oak outside the window dragging its branch across the glass.\n.\nIt might be the spookiest sound you\u2019ve heard all night.\nAria shivers beside you. She\u2019s not looking at the stain or the lamp or the pile of dirty clothes anymore. She\u2019s looking out the window, at the dark silhouette of the branch, like a witch\u2019s hand, dragging on the sill.\nAnd before you can stop her, Aria\u2019s squirming out from under the bed, Rugs in hand. In a flash she jumps under the covers and pulls the quilt over her eyes. You hear her ragged breathing coming fast from beneath the fabric.\nIt takes you longer than it took her, but you join her on the bed.\n\u2018Aria?\u2019 you ask quietly.\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be in the cave anymore,\u2019 she says, \u2018Rugs is scared. Tell a different story?\u2019\nIts late. And you\u2019re starting to feel tired. The adrenaline from studying the poison-shooting jungle frog is wearing thin.\n\u2018I think we need to get some sleep. Rugs, too.\u2019\nThis affects her instantly.\n\u2018I caaan\u2019t!\u2019 she whines. If Rugs talked, he would be whining, too.\nYou rub you temples. But you have an idea.\n\u2018Fine. One more story. Once upon a time, there was a little girl. This little girl wasn\u2019t a pirate, or a princess, or a scientist. She didn\u2019t live on a boat, or in a jungle cave. She lived in a little house on a farm with a hill to the west. And she was sitting on a bed with a blue quilt. And she was holding a ball of kitchen rags wadded together. She called it Bugs.\u2019\nAria\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u2018This girl sounds a lot like me. And Bugs sound a lot like Rugs. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, Iris, but whatever it is, stop it.\u2019\nYou go on.\n\u2018And its storming outside. But here\u2019s the thing: this little girl and her bundle of rags\u2014Bugs\u2014loved storms. And so she walked up to the window and looked out. And she saw God. Well, maybe not God, but she saw something that looked a lot like God. She saw little drops of silver, falling from the sky in the smallest drops. Where had those drops been before? She saw a flash of bright light, like a ray of sunshine, only faster, quicker, smarter, filling the night sky with a powerful blanket of a thousand stars. She saw the fingers of a motherly oak, stroking the windows in a caress. And she heard the most spectacular sound. Like a billion moments of laughter, all bundled up together. Like a collection\u2014a chorus! Of miraculously hilarious instances, let out in a few seconds of built up noise. It was awesome. And the little girl just sat there, for the rest of the thunderstorm, with Bugs by her side, and she watched and listened. And she felt so small. But that felt good. Because there was so much out there\u2014so much awesomeness. And the storm reminded her of that. And then, after she got really tired, she went to sleep. And because she was asleep, her big sister felt safe and secure. And her big sister kissed the little girl\u2019s cheek, and kissed Bugs\u2019\u2026well\u2026kissed on of Bug\u2019s rags, and went to sleep, too. The end.\u2019\nYou cleared your throat. And sat in a moment of silence. Was Aria asleep?\nYou turned to face her. No. no, she was awake. She wasn\u2019t looking at you, though. And she wasn\u2019t looking at the bed-boat, or the lamp-tree. She was looking out the window, at the rain. The lighting. The oak branch rubbing the window. And the thunder boomed loud and powerful and good, and she didn\u2019t hide. She didn\u2019t curl closer to you. She just held Rugs a little tighter, and kept watching.\nAnd she didn\u2019t say a word. She just sat there. And you sat there. But oh, were you tired. Slowly, ever so slowly, you laid down. You closed you eyes. You fell asleep.\nLater, you awoke\u2014but not really. You were half-awake, and half-asleep. Maybe your eyes opened, and maybe they didn\u2019t, but the next morning, you could have sworn you had seen Aria, still watching the window, a small smile playing on her lips.\nHours passed, and then you woke up for real. It was still dark outside. The storm was over. Water droplets were racing each other down the window pane, and the oak\u2019s branch wasn\u2019t waving in the wind anymore.\nAria was next to you, fast asleep.\nYou leaned over and kissed her forehead. And then you kissed Rug\u2019s\u2026well\u2026rag. And you laid down next to your little sister, and let yourself drift off into a world of your on creation. You dreamt of pirate princesses and neon orange sea monsters. Of explorers and poisonous fake-sleeping frogs. And you dreamt of new things, wonderfully crazy things, until morning came."}
{"title": "That Damn Remote", "story": "\tMonths ago, my wife and I had a heated argument over the most ridiculous thing in the world. Our remote for our television disappeared, as they tend to do, which started a domino of exhausted complaints and snarls on both our parts. We checked the recliner cushions, under the sofa, we even checked the damn cat bed at one point. After at least 30 minutes of sprawling around like wild animals, nearly tearing the place up like it too, I sat down and bared our loss. \u201cLet\u2019s just give it a rest and return to this later. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll show up\u201d I suggested.\n\tMy bitter wife expressed the most sour disappointing look I\u2019ve ever seen. A look an old fashion father would give after learning his son was gay while subsequently sucking a juicy lemon. \u201cWay to give up, Gerard! That\u2019s a new one\u201d.\n\tI returned with a sour face of my own, \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\t\u201cYou know what it means! You always do this and it\u2019s why nothing ever gets done. I\u2019d bet you the freaking house we\u2019ll end up just buying a new remote knowing you!\u201d\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting again. For Christ's sake it\u2019s just a remote, Kim. It\u2019ll turn up soon enough and we\u2019ll both look stupid for making such a big deal about it\u201d.\n\tKim threw her hands up in disgust before resting them firmly on her hips as if getting comfortable for one of her rants. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll admit, the remote is a stupid thing. But this isn\u2019t just about the remote at this point. Gerard, this last month you have failed to get the car cleaned, to buy Stavros\u2019 birthday gift and even small things like taking out the trash or feeding the cat. I\u2019m getting pissed that you\u2019ve being so lazy lately\u201d\n\tI sighed, knowing that was just a small part of her complaints. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019ve been working overtime this week, second of all the car is nearly spotless and third of all, you\u2019re just as lazy as me half the time. Those girls nights of yours last hours upon end and all you do is talk about stupid, mind-numbing stuff like work gossip and rom coms. I mean you guys sound like you came right out of desperate housewives in there. Meanwhile our kids rely on me and me alone to see them put to sleep while they wonder why mommy isn\u2019t there to tell them a story or even kiss them goodnight\u201d\n\t\u201cYou volunteered for that responsibility, thank you very much!\u201d she yipped like a dog far too loud for how small it was, \u201cWhen we got married we agreed to our responsibilities, I\u2019m not good with kids and you know that, so you take care of teaching them and all that while I take care of keeping them busy and entertained. I\u2019m grateful that you got that part of your job down, but tell me, why can\u2019t you feed the animal and take the trash out when you can?!\u201d\n\tAt that point our argument had derailed in directions they hadn\u2019t in months if not years. I hate doing that with her but she always made it so difficult to reason. \u201cMaybe you should consider trying. Every think of that? Kids aren\u2019t exactly a walk in the park to deal with but once you put the effort in you can at least know how to talk to them like a parent should. This is a team effort so why do we have to separate ourselves like this?\u201d\n\t\u201cOh so now you're making this about me being a bad parent?\u201d Kim\u2019s voice peaks with genuine shock, \u201cThis is about you being sloppy and lazy over simple little things! I do my part so why can\u2019t you do yours? I hate having to argue like this as much as you do, but if I don\u2019t you\u2019ll just keep this shit up. Heck, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this kept happening for months to come knowing you\u201d.\n\tTaken aback by such a spontaneous situation I sit myself down on our couch. I rest my face into my palms and take a deep, necessary breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is, Kim. But I\u2019m not in the mood to argue any more. Can we please just end this and move on with our night. I\u2019ll sleep on the fucking couch if you want just please. I hope the kids didn\u2019t hear us\u201d\n\t\u201cI hope the kids did!\u201d she shouted, \u201cThey need to know how much of a lazy piece of shit their father is. Maybe then they\u2019ll start talking some sense into you too\u201d\n\t\u201cJust like how they need to know their mother is too much of a coward to love them like she should?! Let\u2019s sleep this off, Kim. We can talk about this tomorrow. And not yell. Talk\u201d\n\tKim began making her way towards the stairs, dimly lit by a nightlight in the corner. Her eyes looked as tired as I felt. I knew she hated to argue as much as I did, which still confuses me as to why she starts these things in the first place. I looked away while I could to make our departure less awkward. I found myself a cozy blanket to shelter myself under for the night and fell into an unsettling slumber accompanied by a dream of our life before the kids. Before getting married. Just two young idiots roaming the country for a nice simple life to share. I imagined how happy we were. How comforting and fulfilled we felt when we embraced. A fairly distant memory I find myself missing more often than I feel I should.\n \n\tThe morning finally came after my near endless depressing void of a dream. I quickly folded the blanket and put it back where it belonged so as to not tempt any questions from our very observant boys. The day went by silently and almost agonizing as it was both a weekend and one of my days off. My wife and I didn\u2019t share a single word throughout the day. We hardly even saw each other. Halfway through it, I noticed the kitchen trash can was overfilling. I thought back on Kim\u2019s words from the night prior and almost ignored it out of spite. But I decided to do the hygenic thing and deal with it before it became a bigger problem. A part of me felt great for doing something productive, however a different side of me felt guilt for doing it after our confrontation. It was almost as if I only did it because of the corner I was backed into. I felt humiliated and disheartened. Even so, I continued to do small things around the house such as sweeping the bathroom floors and wiping down the living room coffee table. I hardly felt any better after each courtesy.\n\tTrying to keep a level head about it, I made my way through the upstairs hall where our bedrooms are to check on our boys. Each passing room waited emptily as I creeped through. That was until I reached the room at the very end, Stavros\u2019 room. I peaked in, slowly and cautiously after hearing soft words and giggles. Kim was sitting on Stravros\u2019 bed, between our sons, talking about possible birthday plans and movies they might want to go see. A warm light thumped in my chest at the sight of it. I hadn\u2019t seen my family so close since the boys were toddlers. Kim had a smile far outreaching any she'd ever had. I no longer felt anything negative doing those chores. I think the two of us grew a little bit from our heated argument.\n\tSince then, our arguments have been far less common, which isn\u2019t to say they don\u2019t exist, but I\u2019m happy to say our marriage has inched a little closer to how we always envisioned it. Kim has spent much more alone time with the boys and I now have a daily routine for small chores around the house.\n\tFunny thing is, the only reason I brought this whole thing up is because I just found that damn remote. \n "}
{"title": "Tea For The Queen", "story": "WRITER NOTE: This is a retrospective for one of my characters, Queen Esther Greath, through her eyes in Chapter 41 of The Blacksmith's Nephew. This also happens to be one of my favorite chapters I have written so please enjoy.\nIt has been nearly four days since I, Queen Esther Greath of the Northern Kingdom of Rissindell, has sent my brave warriors out to save my one and only daughter Ruth. I have been hardly sleeping for the past few days. Each day, I keep on thinking about my daughter and each night, I was having nightmares which were being fueled with the Dark Wizard in them.\nOne night, I dreamt that Ruth gave up hope and said \u201cI do\u201d to the vile villain having to marry him for all eternity. The next night, I dreamt that the Dark Wizard killed all of her brave warriors and took Ruth beyond Rissindell, never to be seen again. But just last night had to be the worst one of them all! Ruth was somehow conceived to set her soul to darkness all thanks to the villain getting into her head. And with that, the two of them appeared in front of me trying to overthrown myself.\nAfter the final one of these series of nightmares, I've decided that I should start drinking hot tea before heading to bed. I was never a fan of tea to begin with but with the endless sleep and unwanted dreams, I had no choice but consider it as an option.\u00a0\n\u00a0It was about 6 o\u2019clock in the evening at the Northern Kingdom. All was quiet throughout the night. Everyone in the village and castle were heading to bed early that evening. Ever since the kidnapping, everyone has been rather sad and depressed for the Princess was truly loved by many. The one who was suffering the most of them all was myself of course.\u00a0\nThere hasn\u2019t been much activity going around in the village because it was mostly Ruth who had made things such enjoyable. My Ruth would organize all kinds of events for us people in the Northern Kingdom. These events inlcluded: festivals, parties, masquerade balls, fashion shows, pie eating completions, singing and dancing contents. Everyone always had a blast at these events hosted by my lovely daughter of mine but with her gone and capture by the evil sorcerer, there was no need for such events.\u00a0\nNo one worked at all and I was completely fine with this. I wouldn\u2019t want my people to be out in case the Dark Wizard comes back to hurt them. Even the kids weren\u2019t playing outside for their parents were awfully concerned about the evilness lurking about the village. Security was really tight within the week of my Ruth being gone. Though there haven\u2019t even been any sorts of crimes at all in the village. This all made made the guards\u2019 job easy yet extremely dull.\nEveryone and everything was quarantined expect for the knights and guards, for they were the essential lookouts during this time of need.\nWith everything being on lockdown mode, I had made sure my people got enough food and drinks to last the whole week. My guards, knights, servants and I gave the villagers the essential supplies for all of them to survive by going to each household. Even my dear best friend, Flavia, and her band of Fanjesters helped out with the supplies.\nI had made sure that Flavia and the Fanjesters would stay at the castle for the entire week. For I wouldn\u2019t and didn't want them to be involved with any of this.\nThey accepted the offer but had no spirit of playing any type of music since Ruth was gone. I couldn't blame them; I won't have the heart for it either. The band was in lockdown as well as everyone else including myself was in the Northern Kingdom.\nIn my bedroom chambers up in the highest tower of the castle was where I slept. Before heading to bed, I had to drink my tea in order to try to get a good night rest. I sat there in my most comfortable chair near by the chimney which was warmed with fire. I wore a blue nightgown that night and with soft, delicate hands of mine, I held the cup as I felt the warmth given from the tea.\nI've requested a guard every night in my chambers while I was alone for I had feared that the Dark Wizard might want me as his next victim. The guard of the night: Aimon gave me my tea which was stored in a pot along with some sugar cubes, honey, and three cups all on a sliver plated tray. I offered Aimon some tea but he politely declined it.\u00a0\nI then sat there and thought about my friend Flavia. We haven\u2019t gotten talk much recently so I requested to have Flavia come join me for a cup of tea. Flavia accepts the invite, and shortly afterwards was seated on a chair next to me drinking some hot tea. Flavia wore a pink pair of onesies that evening. They also acquired white otters on it. She even wore some otters slippers made out of fake fur.\nThe two of us talked for some time once Flavia was acquired for. We chit chatted about the Fanjester\u2019s journey across the country and beyond along with the my years of ruling and raising a child as a widowed parent over a cup of tea.\nThere I was, a more relaxed Queen sitting on a chair by the fire accompanied by a guard, best friend, and hot tea.\nSuddenly the fire in her chimney went out. Myself along with my guard and bestie became startled. A flame came up from the ground. It took shape of a six foot figure, the Dark Wizard: Gerlard, who stood there in the middle of the room grinning at the three of us.\u00a0\nAimon quickly drew out his sword pointing it at the villain yet I held out my hand out for him to remain calm. He withdrew his sword but kept a very close eye on the evil sorcerer standing there before us.\u00a0\nMeanwhile Flavia remained sitting there giving the villain an angry face. She didn\u2019t want him here anymore than Aimon and I do.\n\u201cHello Beautiful, how are you doing on this lovely evening?\u201d asked the villain through his villainous grin. He was referring to me when he asked the question.\n\u201cWhat do you want now Gerlard?\u201d I replied. \u201cYou are getting what you want! My warriors will be there before the week ends. Have you come here to surrender seeing my warriors\u2019 potential of defeating you or did you want to kidnap me while you\u2019re still at it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here for old time\u2019s sakes,\u201d the villain said. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s been years since we had talked, my love. And yes\u2026I know you\u2019re precious warriors are still on their way. I\u2019ve been watching their every move. But no, I will never surrender because I am no quitter. You should know that given our history together. Anyways I\u2019m good with just having your daughter as my prisoner and future wife.\u201d\u00a0\nI responded: \u201cSave it! I don\u2019t want to speak to you! You\u2019re the cause of all of this! First of all, you waged war onto the great people of Rissindell; secondly, you killed my husband, Ruth\u2019s father; third, you made everyone including my own people fear from any magic of the sort; and finally, you have kidnapped my daughter having me to be stressed and exhausted. There is no need to talk to you. You\u2019re just wasting your time.\u201d\n\u201cHa-ha-ha, sweet little Esther...always blaming it all on me for the troubles within the land of Rissindell\u2026\u201d said the villain as he drawls forward. Aimon the guard quickly drew out his sword again while Flavia and I immediately stood up from our cozy chairs. Gerlard sees this and chuckles. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said the villain as he reached for the pot and cup from the table pouring himself some tea.\u00a0\nGerlard poured his tea very dramatically and slow while having the three of us there standing feeling tense. The Dark Wizard takes his first sip from his tea, sighs with relieve and replied: \u201cAh, I do love me some tea\u2026\u201d\nMy dear friend Flavia then chimes in by saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d\n\u201cFlavia, please don\u2019t provoke him,\u201d I whispered to her.\nFlavia looks at me and replied: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, my dear. I can handle this.\u201d She then turns to Gerlard and continues on by saying: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here Gerlard. No one wants you here. You should leave because not only you have been stressing Esther out, but you\u2019ve also have stressed me and the others out as well. All of this stress is killing me because of you kidnapping my precious niece.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cHa,\u201d chuckles the villain while rolling his eyes. He continued: \u201cshe isn\u2019t your actual niece because you both aren\u2019t blood related.\u201d\nFlavia replied with frustration after hearing that comment: \u201cThat all doesn\u2019t matter because I treat her as of my own. She is adopted by heart. Family is more than just being blood related. No matter who we are or where we have come from, we will always be there for each other. SHE IS MY NIECE NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY!\u201d\nI had some tears in my eyes. I've always appreciated that Flavia always treated my daughter as her own niece. But I had no patience with the villain at this point. \u201cGerlard, I\u2019ll ask you one last time: what is it that you want?\u201d\nThe villain stood there mid-sip while the I asked my question once more. He finishes his sip and then replied: \u201cWhy I have missed you oh so very much my dear. The only way I can reach you is through your dreams. You and I both know we had a thing for each other until that fowl king had to come into the picture and ruined everything.\u201d\nI saw that coming. It wasn\u2019t surprising that Gerlard would bring those sorts of stuff up especially with all the things he had pulled in the past. He always had to blame it on someone or something else he has done onto himself. 'I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re arguing over this,' I said this to myself mentally, 'especially when it was his own doing.'\nBut with soft sigh, I replied back: \u201cYes\u2026we did have a thing, but that was a very long time ago before you started talking madness. You talked about wanting unlimited power and gaining control over everyone. Plus, I didn\u2019t like that we were secretly dating considering it was against the rule for a knight to be in any sort of romance. Reuben came to me when I was at my lowest. I was only a milkmaid having with little to no pay. When he visited at the Capital\u2019s market day all those years ago, he had brought all the milk he needed for him and his people. I could see his kindness from my own eyes with that gesture! He also saw something in me no one else could see and neither could I back then, which was my beauty. Since then, I have loved him and he loved me. Reuben\u2019s twice the man you ever will be!\u201d\n\u201cSHUT IT!\u201d shouted Gerlard making his flame burst upward making him look a little taller than he was.\u00a0\nFlavia and I both took a step back. Meanwhile my loyal guard: Aimon went in front of us while we stood behind him.\u00a0\nThe villain then takes his fist over his mouth and coughs, continuing more calmly now: \u201cI loved you and you broke my heart. You should have given me a chance. No one else did and here I was thinking you\u2019ll be different. But nope, I was wrong. You can\u2019t be trusted. Not you, not anyone.\u201d\nI was quite frustrated and tired. I've had enough of this man\u2019s grudge towards me. Yet somehow I had felt a little bad from what he had to go through but even still, his actions were as of a madman.\u00a0\nI sighed once again before continuing with a calm voice: \u201cI had feelings for you too but that was all gone when I saw something in you that I didn\u2019t want. I saw the ugliness from within. I\u2019m sorry for breaking your heart but I couldn\u2019t trust you either with all the things you had did in your past at the Knight\u2019s Academy especially when you started the war. I hope you had made some closure today because I did what I can do for you. Now, please leave and never come back here ever again! And also stay out of my dreams, you creep!\u201d\nGerlard responded:\u00a0\u201cAs a matter of fact: yes, I now have some closure. It was about time I did. You know, you and I are the same if you think about it\u2026Still holds true.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Dark Wizard then threw the tea cup into the chimney causing it to break in pieces onto the warmed logs. The villain then walks away to the middle of the room and slightly turns his head continuing: \u201cAnd thank you Esther for the apology. You were always apologetic.\u201d\nI was furious at this point from what he had said. For what he had said was true. In actuality, Gerlard and I were the same in a sense because both blame each other for what had happened all those years ago. So I threw my cup towards the Dark Wizard but as far as it went, it didn\u2019t hit him for the fire was already gone, deceasing to the floor.\u00a0\nI stood there for a moment with some heavy breathing through my mouth and nose. Aimon withdrew his sword as Flavia attends to me and says: \u201cYou must sit down, Esther dear.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes Flavia, you are right. Thank you honey,\u201d I replied as I sat back down back on my cozy chair with Flavia and Aimon watching over me. I sat there praying in thought as my eyes shut: \u201cLord, please help my dear daughter and brave warriors come back home safe and sound.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter my little prayer, the chimney fire came back after the conversation with Gerlard and the pot was now filled with lukewarm tea.\nAs I seated still there, I thought about the knight rule and how silly it was. I've been thinking of changing it for quite some time now ever since I met Terrance all those years ago. I thought to myself: 'I shall have it taken care of once my warriors come back safely with my one and only daughter.'"}
{"title": "When Emotions Took Shape As Words", "story": "There was a hurricane of activity in the hallway. The atmosphere was exuberant. Ignoring all the frolic, Monika sat at her writing desk and stared at the speck of dust on the window pane, without diverting her gaze even for a second. That tiny speck seemed to take in the myriad eclectic emotions that churned in her heart and created a whirlpool. The paper that lay on the table fluttered in air and made a tapping noise each time in stroked the table. The clock ticked at its pace oblivious to the turmoil in her heart. Her mind was flooded with memories. Both good and bad. She was married at the age of twenty one. Dave was a good man and a wonderful husband. He was everything she had asked for. Two years after their marriage, they were blessed with their first child. She had given up her full time job and worked at a quaint cafeteria in their locality for a few hours everyday. She juggled between her role as a new mother and a part time employee. Her pregnancy glow was replaced by the grime and angst caused by the newly acquired responsibilities.\u00a0\n \nDuring their fourth year of marriage, they were blessed with another child. Tiya was joyous on knowing that she was the elder sister who got to boss around her sibling. John was the quieter of the two. He was more sorted and balanced. He was Monika's ray of hope. She had trusted that he would be there for her in her twilight years just like she was there for him in every walk of his life. Her birdlings developed wings and as much as she enjoyed watching them take their first flight, she dreaded the time when they would leave her nest and build a small world of their own. A few years passed. She was engulfed by the mid life crisis. It was when Dave suggested that she wrote letters. He had gifted her a stack of colorful papers and a set of pens. Letter writing for her was a form of journaling. She wrote letters to her younger self. Her eloquent words spoke about what she missed. She wrote reassuring letters to her older self hoping that they would act as a guiding light in the years to come. She wrote letters to Tiya and John, some of which were read and the others were left unopened. She never inked any letters to Dave though. Her feelings for him were to be felt and understood and not written or read. Dave was good at that. He understood her unspoken words, gauged her camouflaged emotions and wiped her unshed tears. Their hearts beat in synchronization with one another for almost four decades until one morning when Dave's heart stopped. He left the mortal world and took a part of Monika with him. His death shook the earth beneath her. Like sand slipping away from between the fingers, she had begun to drift away from life. Sunrise didn't carry a ray of hope for her any more. The days seemed gloomier and nights felt darker.\u00a0\n \nLoneliness and distress took a toll on her well being. Six months back, she slipped and fell in the bathroom and injured her hips. She was hospitalized for a week and Tiya and John took turns to nurse her back to health. She returned home but her health was status quo. John and Tiya couldn't visit her regularly. They were busy building a little cozy world of their own, a world in which their mother had no place. So they had chosen the easier option. They left her in a convalescent home. The home had nurses and doctors who took care of her. A physiotherapist helped her with her exercises and she was slowly limping back to normalcy. A squealing noise brought her back to the present.\n \nShe looked through the door that was left ajar and saw that her friends were playing with their grandchildren. They made merry as though their presence was permanent. They would all be gone soon and the inhabitants of the home would be loners again. The door opened and her grandchildren entered. \"Granny,\" they shrieked and ran to her. She hugged both of them tightly. A surge of warmth rushed through her veins and her eyes welled with tears. She peered at the door from beyond their shoulders. \"Where is your dad?\" she asked. \"Dad dropped us at the home and left for work. He will be back in the evening,\" said Tom. Lizzie was engrossed in her phone. Headphones were plugged in her ears and she swayed to the music. The technology made Monika feel irrelevant. She felt antiqued. Outdated. Old. Backwards. She felt low about herself. \"What are these?\" asked Tom pointing at the envelopes on the table.\n \n\"Those are the letters I have written to your dad and aunt. I'm yet to post them,\" she replied. Tom looked at her with surprise writ\u00a0all over his face. Lizzie removed the headphone and asked, \"Why do you still write letters in the era of cell phones and emails. You can just ping us whenever you want. It makes the job easier.\" Monika smiled. She was relieved that Lizzie got rid of those clutches that held her ears and robbed her of the present moment. She looked at the letters endearingly and said, \"Letters give a personal touch and a tinge of warmth that the electronic messages lack. Writing a letter takes time and effort but when we put a pen to paper emotions take shape as words and flow freely from the nib. That doesn't happen when you type away on your phone or computer. That feeling of holding a dear one's letter in your hands is priceless. You can feel a whiff of their fragrance. When we read a letter it feels like the one who wrote it is conversing with us. We can hear their words, feel their emotions, caress their tears and share their smile. Letter writing is magic.\"\n \nLizzie looked at her and rolled her eyes. \"Isn't it time consuming? You can type and send a message in the blink of an eye. Letter writing is boring,\" she remarked.\u00a0\n\"Writing a letter takes time. So does forging a relationship. In the era of two minute noodles and instant fixes one doesn't enjoy the process of doing things. Everything has become use and throw. Read and delete,\" said Monika and walked to the cabinet and opened it. She reached for a mahogany box. Placing it on the table, she opened it. The letters were torn at the edges. They had seen the good, bad and worst days. Ink was smudged at a place or two yet they were precious as were the memories. The letters carried the words written by Monika's mother. It gave an account of their lives. Picking up a letter from among the lot, Monika began to read it. \"You have always made us proud,\" she almost choked. \"My mother had written these letters many decades back. Whenever I read them I feel that she is by my side, protecting me and guiding me. Letter writing might have become irrelevant with time. But it is cathartic and soul invigorating,\" said Monika.\u00a0\n \nLizzie nodded. She diverted her gaze. Maybe she had nothing to say in\u00a0her defense or she wanted to respect her granny's opinion. She chose to embrace silence. \"I have written more than two hundred letters,\" Monika claimed with pride while Lizzie looked at her phone and nodded absent mindedly. The sound of pen rolling on the paper diverted Monika's attention. She turned and saw that Tom was scribbling away. \"What are you doing?\" asked Monika. \"Oh, I'm trying to write my first letter,\" he said. Tears threatened to bite the corner of Monika's eyes. \"Will you help me\" he asked.  Joy flowed out as tears and she agreed.\u00a0\n \nDear Ruby, I love your smile he began to write. \"Who's Ruby?\" she asked. \"My would be girlfriend,\" grinned Tom and continued to write. Monika helped him with the words. Lizzie watched them indulge in their favorite activity. Monika wasn't sure if Tom wanted to write a letter for his happiness or to make her happy? But she enjoyed the process. For the first time in years, she felt relevant. She felt important and useful. Tom was an empathetic kid. She stroked his hair gently and blessed him. She knew that a few hours later, she would be an empty nester again. She would be alone and unattended. She would have wait for months to see her children and grand children. But putting the painaway for another day, she revelled in the present moment. After all, the present was present from God.\u00a0\n "}
{"title": "You're Just So Intolerant", "story": "Content warning: this story contains allergens!\n\"I've thought about it, and it's chocolate.\"\n\"Well that sounds good to me. Thought about what?\"\n\"What you asked me earlier. Chocolate, it's a universal panacea.\"\n\"I didn't ask \n?' is a universal panacea. I asked \n' a universal panacea. It's all in the inflection and the emphasis.\"\n\"Oh, well you obviously inflected in the wrong place. That's so you. Nice pyjamas by the way. Are you comfy?\"\n\"Yes, thanks. I could have slept on the air-bed, I didn't mind. I like your jimjams too, cute little bears. So what is it then?\"\n\"I'm so glad you asked. It's the cure for all ills. Everything. Pain, sorrow, illness, World War III, the lot. I thought about it for a couple of hours and it's definitely chocolate.\"\n\"Erm, does the United Nations know about this? Or the World Health Organisation? Hmm, \n. Do you really think chocolate solves everything?\"\n\"Well, it does for me. Remember when I scraped my first car? I cried for a week but KitKat got me through it. And when Dan left, it was M&M's.\"\n\"You sobbed and snorted in the bag. It was disgusting.\"\n\"I still ate them. It made me realise I loved M&M's more than I loved Dan. He tried to come back, but I was stronger then. And he brought flowers from a petrol station.\"\n\"Cheapskate! That's hardly universal though, is it? Just you, and\u2026 were they the peanut ones? I mean, does that even count as chocolate? And why is it universal, and not a world panacea? What works on Earth might not do much on Jupiter. Or Alpha Centauri. Or the Crab Nebula. Do you want that pillow? I could do with another. Ow, you didn't need to throw it.\"\n\"It's good though, you've got to admit it. If someone, or something, did turn up from Orion's Belt, you'd give them a Crunchie. They'd love it and not invade Earth, because they're full of peace and joy and Cadbury's. It's the pheromones.\"\n\"I think you mean endorphins. What if it's Hersheys? Or Nestle? Ooh, or Belgian chocolate, like those little seahorses and seashells with praline in the middle?\"\n\"Now you're just being pedantic. Mind you, I'd invade Earth for Belgian chocolate seashells with praline, or those hazelnut noisettes. What time do you have to go in the morning?\"\n\"My train is at nine so set the alarm for seven, would you, please. Sorry that's early, but I'll have time for Coco-Pops before I go. Get my endorphins going. I'm not invading anywhere tomorrow,\"\n\"Haha, you're good! But anyway I'm right, aren't I. Everyone loves chocolate.\"\n\"What if you're dairy or lactose intolerant?\n\"Really? Like 2 or 3 people?\n\"Forty two million, although most of them don't know it.\"\n\"You're blowing my mind. They still love chocolate though.\"\n\"Endorphinately.\"\n\"I hate you.\"\n\"You'll miss me when I'm gone.\n\"I'm ignoring that. Okay, so it's a universal panacea for everyone who isn't dairy or lactose intolerant.\"\n\"Or diabetic.\"\n\"I'm starting to remember why I left home.\"\n\"Or gluten-free.\"\n\"Oh come on! A little bit won't hurt.\"\n\"Don't go there! I was sick for a fortnight last time.\"\n\"There's no gluten in chocolate. Is mum picking you up from the station? I have a birthday present for her if you'd take it.\"\n\"You don't read labels do you? Think about the KitKat. Yes, I can take it. What is it, chocolate?\"\n\"Funny. Okay, so we're settled. Chocolate is a universal panacea for anyone who isn't diabetic, or dairy, lactose or gluten intolerant. Are you happy now?\"\n\"You're forgetting soya. It's an allergen.\"\n\"What? Are you kidding? There's soya in chocolate? So far as I'm concerned, chocolate is the answer to 'life, the universe and everything,' not 42. Douglas Adams just had the wrong computer program running.\"\n\"But the best punchlines.\"\n\"I can't believe we're arguing over this.\"\n\"Who's arguing? You said chocolate, and I just pointed out you were wrong.\"\n\"Yep, you love doing that.\"\n\"I'm your sister. You should know by now, it's compulsory. You'll miss me when I'm gone.\"\n\"I'm still ignoring that. Why did you ask anyway? It's not your usual dinner table conversation. It's usually strange things.\"\n\"You mean, \n.\"\n\"I know what I meant.\"\n\"Gee thanks! Dad said to mum, 'wine is a universal panacea,' I wondered what he meant.\"\n\"Wine? What's he talking about? Was he drunk? There's sulphites in wine. And hangovers. And what about the Baptists? Or the population of Yemen?\"\n\"Yemen? We went to see that film, Salmon Fishing in The Yemen.\"\n\"I know. You ate my popcorn and drooled over Ewan McGregor. Yemenis don't drink alcohol.\"\n\"Oh God!\"\n\"Nope, forget God, there's been too many religious wars. Religion always kills someone.\"\n\"I wasn't suggesting God as a universal panacea, I was drooling over Ewan McGregor again. Although God is more universal than chocolate, I guess. Stop pulling faces. What's your beef?\"\n\"No good. You've just alienated the vegans, vegetarians, and pescetarians. And probably a few sagittarians. \"\n\"That's part man, part horse, not cow. You're nuts!\"\n\"Nuts? They're an allergen, and a choking hazard. You can't open a bag of peanuts on a plane anymore, not if there's a passenger with allergies. Did you know?\"\n\"Pfft. I'm going to choke you, in a minute! Or smother you with this pillow. Or let the air out of that mattress.\"\n\"Tough guy. Says, \n?\"\n\"Sesame.\"\n\"Hahaha, do you fancy a hot chocolate drink before you go to sleep? And yes, sweetie, I will miss you when you're gone.\"\n\"Sleep, that's it! That's the universal panacea. Everyone sleeps, and like Mum says, 'it always looks better in the morning.' Go tell the world.\"\n\"Not if you've got sleep apnea. Ow, no, get off, get off.\"\n\"Night sis.

{"title": "Escape", "story": "The first time it happened Cassie thought it was a dream, that she must have been asleep, and dreaming. Since that day, now and then, she had felt a similar sensation when she concentrated on Sonny, in the sliding of taut muscle or the shiver of skin under the tickle of a fly. On this sunny summer Saturday, Cassie was sitting in her favourite place in Sonny's paddock, her back against the steel gate and her legs stretched out in front of her, when it happened again. The morning sun was warm on her shoulder and the side of her face, and glinted in copper shards from Sonny\u2019s chestnut coat as he grazed barely metres away. He munched with a steady rhythm, and she had closed her eyes against the glare of the sun, harsh and bright now as the morning stretched out.\u00a0The next thing she knew, she was snatching the soft green strands between her own teeth, ripping with a slight sideways twitch, and feeling in her mouth the miraculous dance of lips, teeth, and tongue. She could taste the succulent grass, sugar-sweet and pungent.\nA cry from the house startled Sonny, and as one the two heads swung and looked. Laura, Cassie's big sister, was standing on the front deck and waving. \u2018Cassie! Granny\u2019s here.\u2019 Cassie was sure she felt her own ears swivel and prick forward at Laura\u2019s call. Laura once had a friend visit who could wriggle his ears, and after he'd gone Cassie sat in front of the mirror and tried to make hers move, tried and tried, but nothing happened.\u00a0Before she was interrupted just then, it had felt like she was doing it. If only she could be a horse! But for now, she was just Cassie again. She scrambled to her feet and hurried over to the house, the circulation returning painfully to her rear.\nThey had moved here from the city six months ago, partly to be closer to Granny since Grandad had died, and partly because Mummy had excelled her highly motivated self to win an important job at the borough council. Since the move, Cassie\u2019s world had changed in every way. She didn\u2019t like her new school. She always seemed to say the wrong thing; the other children didn\u2019t understand her thoughts, and stared or smirked at her questions. Mummy was hardly ever home, trying hard in her new job to \u2018make a good impression\u2019 and \u2018prove herself\u2019, always at work, even on auspicious Saturdays like today. When she was home, she seemed distracted and unreachable, constantly finding fault and out of sorts. Cassie was never sure what she had done wrong or how to fix it. The only good thing about the move was darling Sonny, the elderly chestnut gelding who had come with the property.\nHer yearnings receded as she ran to greet Granny with a hug and kiss. She loved Granny\u2019s visits. She seemed to have a unifying effect on the whole family. Mummy would be lots calmer; she could even be quiet and kind. Laura played for longer with her, and Daddy tried hard, too. He often answered her questions when Granny was here, the sort of questions he usually\u00a0grunted at or ignored. She was six and she had a lot of questions.\n\u2018Granny, can people turn into animals?\u2019\n\u2018You mean like a shape shifter? People used to believe that, once. They thought it was a punishment from the gods, or a way to escape unpleasantness.\u2019 Granny studied her thoughtfully.\u00a0\u2018Why do you ask, my darling?\u2019\n\u2018I think I was turning into a horse just before.\u2019 Granny smiled indulgently, and Cassie was suddenly cross with her. \u2018Really, I \n.\u2019\n\u2018What would you do if you were a horse?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d eat grass and then I\u2019d gallop around and around. And then I\u2019d be itchy so I\u2019d lie down and roll, and then I\u2019d stand up and jump and kick.\u2019 With enthusiasm Cassie demonstrated on the bouncy turf. 'Sonny would be my best friend and we'd be together always. And no one would be grumpy and shout and tell me I was naughty.\u2019\n\u2018You would make a lovely chestnut pony,\u2019 said Granny, \u2018with your hair that colour. It\u2019s like Sonny\u2019s coat in summer.\u2019 She gathered the little girl into a hug, but as she did it she tightened her lips and frowned over Cassie\u2019s head. \u2018You aren\u2019t naughty my sweet, you\u2019re a good girl.\u2019\n\u2018Mummy said I was naughty this morning though,\u2019 said Cassie, twisting out of the old lady\u2019s embrace and gazing up into the sweet familiar face. \u2018I just wanted to see Sonny before breakfast, and she said if I went, I couldn\u2019t have any, so I ran outside with my toast.\u2019\n'Oh dear,\u2019 sighed Granny.\n\u2018And then Mummy went to work and she didn\u2019t say goodbye.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose she was running late. Never mind, you can say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 tonight when she gets home.\u2019 Cassie agreed that she would and felt comforted. She would recite a little speech, after which Mummy would hug her and they would both say, \u2018I love you.\u2019 Maybe then everything would be all right again.\n\u2018Are you here all day, Granny?\u2019\n\u2018Yes dear. Your dad won\u2019t be back from golf until late. If his day goes according to plan and he wins the club champs, he will have to stay and shout the bar.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe he won\u2019t win,\u2019 said Cassie, and hoped he wouldn\u2019t. She immediately felt bad. Winning was important to Daddy, and she wanted him to be happy. If only he could win and come straight home!\n'I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll win. He has been practicing every day since you moved here, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, he has,\u2019 Cassie said. \u2018Every day. He doesn\u2019t even have time to read my story, and I\u2019ll never find out what happens to Harry and Ron and Hermione.\u2019\nShe was interrupted by the sound of wheels on the gravel drive. \u2018Bye Granny, bye Cassie!\u2019 Laura was waving from the window of the plum-coloured Corolla, the extra car they found they needed now they lived in the country. There was no public transport out here, so as soon as Laura turned sixteen she got her restricted licence. Now she was independent, able to drive herself anywhere she wanted to go. When she had her full licence, she had promised, she would take Cassie sometimes, but for now Cassie had to stay behind. \u2018Where\u2019s Laura going, Granny?\u2019\n\u2018She has a practice for the high school stage challenge, didn\u2019t she tell you? Then she\u2019ll probably hang out with her friends. Which means it\u2019s just you and me! Hooray!\u2019 Granny hoisted two fists in a victory salute, but Cassie turned away, bottom lip between her teeth, and watched the car until it turned at the gate and disappeared on the road into town.\nLaura didn't return until the sun had lost its warmth and the fence posts were leaving long bars of shadow on the grass beside Sonny\u2019s paddock. Granny left then, with waves and kisses. Cassie had prepared a contrite little speech for her mother, which she perfected as she snuggled up in bed that night. But the speech was wasted as her mother didn\u2019t get home until late, when Cassie was already asleep and dreaming of galloping and bucking across green hills as a chunky chestnut pony.\nIt was another cheerful morning full of light and birdsong. Cassie woke to a restless urgency, and crept outside while the house slept, to watch the dawn with Sonny. The grass was drenched with dew, so she stood and leaned her back on Sonny's comforting shoulder, moving when he moved, facing the mound of hill to the east, black against a lime-green morning sky. When the first rays of the sun stroked her forehead, she closed her eyes and wallowed, lizard-like, in its warmth.\nIt was much later when Laura opened her bedroom curtains and looked across the lawn to Sonny\u2019s paddock, to see a second chestnut grazing beside him, smaller and lighter with a deep russet mane and tail. She immediately thought of Cassie and how excited she would be. She hustled along to her sister\u2019s bedroom door and pushed it open. \u2018Cassie look, there\u2019s a pony in the paddock with Sonny, and its mane and tail are exactly the same colour as your hair\u2026. wake up sleepyhead!\u2019. The room was still dark, and she peered at Cassie\u2019s bed, willing her eyes to adjust in the dimness. One corner of the top sheet trailed on the floor, but there was no mound of fiery hair on the pillow where it should have been. \u2019CASSIE?\u2019 Laura turned and shouted through the open door. \u2018Muuum! Dad! \n?\u2019\nBeyond the steel gate, the strange pony raised her head and pricked her ears. She gave a little buck, raced once around the paddock, then blasted back to stand beside Sonny, toss her mane, and stare."}
{"title": "Gingerbread Mafia", "story": "Many folk tales describe hapless children marking their paths with stones, to not get lost. Now, it\u2019s become a thing. Once humble hiking trails have transformed into gleaming, shimmering paths to a fantasyland. Or to the dark lair of a witch. \nTrends, fads and fashions prove spontaneous generation. Like \u2018love locks\u2019 on a bridge. Who expects the weight of so many padlocks to threaten its structural integrity? What captures the popular imagination?\nAlways innovating, the fad had outliers. A flock of birds reportedly swarmed a man tossing morsels of bread on paths. \nAnother report described a trail of peanut butter cups. \nThe sale of sparkling, pretty rocks had blossomed. And where money grows, the tax man reapeth. \nInvestigators Hansel Cutterson, and Keith Chekov, drove into the mountains. Their destination, the Pebble and Crumb tavern. Their assignment, investigate the trafficking of semi-precious stones. Mere stones held little interest. But talk money laundering, and everyone listens. \nLocal news featured two young men with a coin filled canvas sack. One walked a trail and placed a coin every few yards. Once his sack had emptied, he rested on the roadside.\nHis partner followed a mile back. He retrieved each coin. Reaching his friend while lugging his bulging money bag, they would begin again. They claimed to be philosophers, and insisted they ended each hike richer than before.\nHans never knew philosophers to flaunt their wealth. Could money laundering enhance their magic? \nThe fad, grown so popular with young romantics, led to crowded trails. Traditional hikers and \u2018pebble pickers\u2019 disputed over rights-of-way. Chaos ensued. Violence loomed.\nIt fell to the tax office to rein things in.\nLegend held a witch ran the Pebble and Crumb, a ridgetop watering hole for hikers. P&C\u2019s fortunes rose along with the popularity of semi-precious stones. \nHansel and Keith pulled into the tavern\u2019s empty lot. If you ignored the \u2018wicked witch\u2019 subtext, P&C\u2019s classic gingerbread design was cute. Aromatic smoke poured from the chimney of the converted cabin. The adjoining herb garden boasted a team of gnomes.\nHansel said, \u201cStay sharp. I\u2019ll do the talking.\u201d\nThe simple bar had three taps, several small tables and vintage pinball and video games. Candles flickered. Black and white photos and prints adorned the walls. Keith pointed to a display case filled with various crystals.\nThe wizened proprietress watched from behind the bar. Her youthful spirit belied her advanced age.\nHansel approached the counter with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a nice place here.\u201d\n\u201cHard work. Never got a freebie in my life.\u201d They kept looking around. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\n\u201cJust coffee. On the clock, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou a cop?\u201d\n\u201cNo. County inspector.\u201d\n\u201cYou look like a cop.\u201d\nThe men glanced at each other.\nHansel said, \u201cMs. Bread?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my name. Don\u2019t wear it out.\u201d\n\u201cGinger, right?\u201d\n\u201cGinny.\u201d\n\u201cBusiness good?\u201d\n\u201cBetter than usual. What you want?\u201d\n\u201cWe received reports of increased\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWait, I know you. You\u2019re Cutterson. Woody\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my father.\u201d\n\u201cRight, you\u2019re Han\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHansel.\u201d\nShe began yelling. Moving about, brandishing a broom handle, she seemed everywhere at once. \n\u201cStay back!\u201d\n\u201cJust have a few questions\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cOh, no, no, no. I\u2019m not going through that again. Get out!\u201d Hansel and Keith stood and watched. \u201cI need a lawyer? Calling him now. Shut you down so fast... Harassment! He knows.\u201d\n\u201cGinger! I\u2019m not here for that. If I knew it was you, I would\u2018ve sent someone else. We\u2019re following a report we received. No one\u2019s accusing you of anything.\u201d\nShe stopped and gave them a hard look. \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cYou know anything about moonstone trafficking?\u201d\nShe dismissed them with a wave. \u201cNah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Here\u2019s my card.\u201d\nShe glanced at it. It read: Hansel Cutterson, County Tax Inspector. \nShe snorted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything \u2018bout inspecting pebbles.\u201d\n\u201cIf you hear of anything, give me a call. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nShe stared. \u201cReally? That\u2019s it?\u201d\nThe men looked at each other and shrugged. She let her guard down. They started for the door. On second thought, Hansel turned.\n\u201cSince I\u2019m here, Ginny. I want to tell you how bad I feel for what I put you through, back then. Hope there\u2019s no hard feelings.\u201d \nShe sighed and strode behind the bar. \u201cStill want that coffee?\u201d\n\u201cSure\u2026 Not being a hard case. Just doin\u2019 our jobs.\u201d\nShe poured two coffees and pointed to the creamer and sugar.\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s Gretel?\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Moved back east. Got married. I\u2019m an uncle! Six times over. Think they\u2019re in college now.\u201d\nGinny laughed. She leaned in and addressed Keith. \u201cShe was a feisty thing. Don\u2019t cross that chick.\u201d\n\u201cDuly noted.\u201d\nShe thought back. \u201c\u2026Terrible what happened to that little, Ms. Hood. Her granny and I went way back. Nice old broad. Tough... What that predator did\u2026 He got his\u2026\u201d\nHansel nodded to Keith. \nHer tone changed. \u201cBut that Goldilocks slut\u2026 She asked for it. What an entitled twit.\u201d\nKeith spoke up. \u201cBut she was\u2026\u201d\nHansel stopped him with a look.\nLost in thought, Ginger continued. \u201cYeah\u2026 Those were wild times. The press raped me. Never got to tell my side. No one cared.\u201d\n\u201cBut you stuck around. Built this place. Did alright\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI tried a new start. No point. Always some newshound sniffing around, butting in\u2026 breaking a \u2018new story.\u2019 Expos\u00e9! Make a splash. Dish the dirt. Like a dog returning to its own\u2026 You know\u2026 Old lies sell better than a fresh, boring truth.\u201d\nThe men sipped their coffees and listened. She refreshed their cups.\n\u201cBetter hide in plain sight. Nothin\u2019 to see. Move along. Nobody\u2019s got anything on me, that everybody hasn\u2019t seen. Just an old witch with no secrets. Like it like that.\u201d\nShe looked about and stood straight. She smiled and gestured to the room.\n\u201cHas a certain cache, don\u2019t you think? Come curious, leave full of food and fun. Come back and bring friends. Business\u2019s picking up lately\u2026\u201d\nShe looked at Hansel and got serious. \n\u201cHansel, don\u2019t you worry \u2018bout what happened. You were a know-nothing kid. But don\u2019t get me started on your sister\u2026\u201d He laughed. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t mean nothing. Brought it on myself. Was the adult in the room, or so they said.\u201d\nHansel nodded. \nShe shifted attention. \u201cWant some live entertainment up here. With all these pebble pushers\u2026 who knows?\u201d\nHansel picked up the tab. They turned to leave. \nShe said, \u201cBye the way. Don\u2019t know about no moonstones. But if I hear something\u2026 Someone I know might know someone\u2026 You know the drill... But it can\u2019t come back to me. I never said a thing.\u201d\nHansel said, \u201cOf course, Ginny. Good coffee, by the way. Later\u2026\u201d\nThey exited into the early evening. A line of hikers approached the tavern.\nKeith said, \u201cHans, what was that about? You know her?\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cDo I look like the brothers Grimm to you? I could tell you a hair-raising story about Gretel and me fighting for our lives, PTSD and waking up with the sweats. But I never met her. No sister named Gretel.\u201d\nTrying to understand, Keith shook his head.\nHansel continued, \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about this witch forever. I wondered how she\u2019d react to my name. You have to roll with it. Relax. Get her talking.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but\u2026 she knew you\u2026\u201d\nHansel scoffed. \u201cThis is why we need hard evidence. People like Ginger blow hot or cold. She could help us build a solid. Or she wakes up tomorrow, flies to Neverland, and pins the whole shmegegge on the little Mermaid.\u201d\nKeith laughed as they got to the car.\nHansel continued, \u201cOnce a perp called in Sasquatch as a witness to his alibi.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d\n\u201cTrue story\u2026 Try to serve that subpoena\u2026 Had to line up three interpreters, in case he didn\u2019t speak English.\u201d Keith pounded the steering wheel. \u201cOf course, he didn\u2019t show.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, we might\u2026 might have a source with Ginger.\u201d\n\u201cSo, Betty Boop\u2019s for dinner?\u201d\n\u201cSounds good\u2026\u201d\nThey laughed as Hansel merged into traffic."}
{"title": "Why Is The Answer", "story": "\u201cAre you coming to bed?\u201d\nThe voice startled Jay, and instinctively he placed his phone in his pocket before answering. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a second, what are you doing up?\u201d Jay\u2019s question was more of a defense mechanism than a quest for knowledge. He was less concerned as to why Pam was up than \n she was up.\n\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d She asked, sitting down before Jay had a chance to answer. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d\nIn the decade Jay had been married\u2014\nwas second to only\u2014\nin his list of things he didn\u2019t want to hear, but experience had taught him there was only one correct answer.\n\u201cSure, what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember our wedding day?\u201d Pam asked, \u201cAnd Pastor Richard?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. It was the happiest day of my life,\u201d Jay answered. His response was both true and ironic. Pam didn\u2019t come from money and Jay barely had a nickel to his name so the two young lovers had been married on a beach just before sunset. The guests sat in folding chairs they brought themselves and the altar was nothing more than two tiki torches stuck in the sand at the end of a makeshift aisle. Unable to afford a minister, Jay and Pam had been married by a friend everyone called Pastor Richard.\u00a0His name was Richard, to be sure, but he was not a pastor, not a trained one at least. He was, however, the type of person who saw truths in life that most people didn\u2019t and there was no one else either Pam or Jay would have wanted to perform the task of joining them in holy matrimony than the unkempt but wise man. Yes, Jay remembered the day and the man, but the memory was no longer a pleasant one.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about what he said,\u201d Pam continued, \u201cHe told us that why was not the question, it was the answer.\u201d\nA smile came over Jay\u2019s face. He remembered vividly the advice Pastor Richard had given them before they took their vows. He had squatted down in front of the couple and placed two dots in the sand a foot from each other. There had been no rehearsal or even discussion of the ceremony so both Pam and Jay were surprised with the sight of their friend as he used the only canvass available to him.\n\u201cThis dot is you,\u201d he said, pointing at the dot on the right and then at Jay. \u201cAnd this one is you,\u201d he said, doing the same with the second dot and Pam. \u201cThe paths of your lives have brought you together, here today, right now,\u201d he said as he drew diagonal lines from each dot to a midpoint between the two. \u201cYou were on separate paths but no longer, now you walk life\u2019s path as one,\u201d and with that, he drew a single line towards the young couple and stood back up straight. \u201cIf you want to find the true reward of the oneness you seek today, you\u2019ll remember that \u2018Y\u2019 is the answer, not the question.\u201d\u00a0\nJay remembered how struck he had been by the simple lesson Pastor Richard had taught that day. Life was a path and he had committed to share his path with Pam the same way she had promised to share hers with him.\n\u201cPastor Richard had a unique ability to see the truth and to share it,\u201d Jay said, smiling at Pam for the first time in what seemed like years, \u201cWhat made you think of that?\u201d\n\u201cHonestly I was thinking more about the warning. Do you remember?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Jay responded, instantly aware of where the conversation was headed, \u201cHe warned us about being halfway in.\u201d\n\u201cIt was more than that though,\u201d Pam reminded, \u201cHe told us to beware of the paths to the side. I don\u2019t think we listened to him that day. I pictured what our life would be and this reality just doesn\u2019t match that picture.\u201d\nJay instantly knew Pam was right, Pastor Richard had not stopped when he had drawn the \u2018Y\u2019 in the sand. He had squatted back down and started drawing lines off the unified path. \u201cThis is you choosing your friends over Pam,\u201d he said to Jay as he drew a line out to the right. \u201cAnd this is you, Pam, siding with your parents rather than with your husband,\u201d he said, as he drew a line to the left. \u201cHobbies, work, and even children can be fatal distractions if you let them,\u201d he said as he drew multiple lines to the left and right. \u201cBefore you know it \u2018Y\u2019 is no longer an answer because it\u2019s no longer a \u2018Y\u2019.\u00a0\nJay who had been looking at the floor, imagining the sandy beach where he had promised to love Pam for the rest of his life, looked up in time to see a single tear fall from his wife\u2019s eye.\n\u201cIs it too late?\u201d Pam asked as she stood up and turned toward the bedroom. \u201cDon\u2019t be long, I don\u2019t sleep well without you next to me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jay said, with a certainty, even he didn\u2019t understand.\n\u201cNo?\u201d Pam asked, turning back towards her husband.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not too late. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d\nPam smiled and turned back towards the bedroom as Jay pulled his phone out of his pocket.\nThe text was still there waiting to be sent. \nJay had allowed pleasant conversation to become flirting and he had finally asked for her number. He knew the moment he did that he had crossed a line but trial and circumstance had worn him down. Now, where a lack of focus had dwelled only a few seconds earlier, Jay found clarity. It only took a few seconds to delete the unsent text. \u201cY is the answer,\u201d Jay said softly to himself as he also deleted the contact from his phone and headed where he belonged, to his bed, next to his wife."}
{"title": "A Story About Someone Trying To Become A Better Person", "story": "\tHere is a story about someone trying to become a better person.\u00a0\n\tHere is a carnival and a summertime of any year and lights and people and joyful screaming. Look at the sturgeon moon stamped onto the black sky. Now, if you would, walk out of the crowd and into a darker part of the carnival. You can come back later.\u00a0\n\tAfter a silent walk along slick, dark grass- yes, I know, a carnival in the dark? You're too bound by habit. Have a little imagination. Anyway. After your walk here is a single booth.\u00a0\n\tHere is a man in a dark suit, standing in his single booth. And here are the lamb heads stuck to the walls, eyes crusted with blood, definitely alive once and definitely not now. Now we have the pieces.\u00a0\n\tWatch. Here is a young woman, young by her own standards, anyway, with dark hair and a blue silk scarf. Watch her steps, focused and measured. Here is the wet grass of the carnival field and the man's raised head and small, ugly smile as she approaches the booth with practiced shyness.\u00a0\n\t\"It's twenty-five tokens to try.\" he says quietly.\u00a0\n\tHere comes her nod.\u00a0\n\tTwenty-five tokens to try. Tale as old as time.\n\tHere is the purse and the plastic coins and the hands briefly touching, no not like that, she is married and he is not that kind of man, and here is the dagger, silver and angry.\u00a0\n\tSee how the woman looks at the knife, like it could kill her itself without her intervention. Remember that this is a story about someone trying to become a better person, if you can.\u00a0\n\tNow, if you will, watch the man as he turns into the darkness of the booth. He's walking out in his polished black shoes to the backyard. It\u2019s quieter back here, away from the noise of the carnival. There\u2019s a reason he chose to put his stand a little ways away. This needs silence. He comes to a stop in front of the tall wooden fence.\u00a0\n\tSee, and I am sorry about this, but see the agitated lambs behind the backer rails. He's picking one of them up at random. He's a businessman, not a monster. He doesn't care which one dies.\u00a0\n\tThe lamb, of course, is bleating and kicking and screaming, and the woman is waiting patiently outside, the way young women with dark hair and blue scarves are wont to do, and the man is walking steadfastly back to the booth as the lamb screams, for, what, its mother? The fence?\u00a0\n\tSee her fingers run over the hilt of the dagger. Watch as she bites her lip; she has a question.\u00a0\n\t\"Is it very painful?\"\u00a0\n\tA pause. Remember what this story is about. Always remember. Watch as the man puffs his chest as he answers.\u00a0\n\t\"No! As long as you do it well.\"\u00a0\n\t(He means to encourage her to hit the heart. Many other patrons hit the stomach, and you know how that goes.)\u00a0\n\t\"I will.\"\u00a0\n\tPay attention now. She is tensing her arm and clenching her jaw. He is doing the same. Who is more frightened?\u00a0\n\tWell?\u00a0\n\tAnyway. An adult sheep is tied up a hundred yards away, straining at her rope. Look at her panic, not a slaughterhouse panic but a motherly one. A panic of runningto rather than runningaway.\u00a0\n\tHe closes his eyes, and she steadies something snakelike writhing inside herself. He lets go of the lamb and whistles in an entirely nonmusical way.\u00a0\n\tHere! Here, watch! The lamb is running across the fairground and her mother is bleating in joy, and the lamb's dark animal eyes are shining and catching the light of the stars! This is deeply joyous, but you want to see the woman and the knife and the man, I know.\u00a0\n\tWell, fine. Here she is throwing the dagger, something in her face dying as she lets go of the hilt with a practiced flick of the wrist. Here is the dagger spinning out! And here is the lamb stumbling on its long lamb legs, almost to its big sheep mother who will keep it warm forever!\u00a0\n\tShe misses! The knife hits the ground, piercing the soil. The woman\u2019s hair looks a little less dark as she retrieves it and throws it again at the hesitant lamb.\u00a0\n\tDaggers are faster than carnival-dwelling lambs, so watch, if you can, as the blade slices through the air for a second time. The lamb keeps its little lamb face on its mothers soft sheep body. The dark-haired woman averts her eyes and swallows down something dark before it can reach her lips or the cool night air.\u00a0\n\tBut wait: she begins to shout in confusion and anger, but the lamb\u2019s white wool remains unstained with blood, so what can be the reason?\u00a0\n\tWell, you were watching the lamb and the knife and the woman, and you have forgotten to watch the man, haven\u2019t you?\u00a0\n\tHere he is running as the woman shouts angrily. Here is the man running, running, running across the slick grass trying to catch the knife as it draws closer to the inside the caverns of the lamb\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\tHere is the look of terror on his face, of regret and speed and trying-to-make-up-for-it-all. Here is the knife and the man and the man and the knife and the woman and the lamb and the knife and the night and the ferris wheel and the booth and the mother sheep straining at her rope! Here is the man and the woman colliding as he uses his manbody to stop her from taking up the dagger for a third time, and here she is in understandable shock, after all, he said twenty five tokens to try, and she\u2019s paid her twenty five tokens, so what\u2019s this?\u00a0\n\tHere is hand grazing dagger hilt and woman falling silent.\u00a0\n\tMen, as a rule, can\u2019t run faster than daggers any more than lambs can, and this particular man can\u2019t run faster than dark haired women with blue scarves. So, here is the dagger thrown for the third time as the lamb stands by its mother.\u00a0\n\tNobody can quite believe what\u2019s happened. Then.\u00a0\n\tHere is a screaming, screaming lamb and an agitated silent mother stomping at the wet carnival grass. Here is a lamb that isn\u2019t screaming anymore, but, oh, a man that is.\u00a0\n\tWatch him as he falls to his knees in his expensive carnival suit, wailing to nothing, kneeling outside his out-of-the-way booth. The woman\u2019s lips form a thin line as she stands up. He is screaming and screaming and crying and the lamb is twitching and the knife is completely silent in a rather self-satisfied way.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d\u00a0\n\tHe won\u2019t stop yelling and kissing the lamb\u2019s face and grabbing its hooves and holding his hand over its bleeding stomach. He won\u2019t stop shouting thick apologies to the silent sheep standing over him.\u00a0\n\tJust watch for a second. Don\u2019t forget who opened the booth.\u00a0\nHe stops screaming and grabs at the mother sheep\u2019s wool. Silence. The woman with dark hair and a blue scarf can\u2019t decide whether to stay or go. She\u2019s young enough to stay.\u00a0\n\tHave you noticed the man\u2019s eyes? He doesn\u2019t have spectacles, by the way. They\u2019re big and brown and dark, and so are the mother sheep\u2019s. He takes the dagger from the lamb\u2019s stomach, which makes its body shiver.\u00a0\n\tHere are two pairs of eyes. Here is one set of hooves and one set of manhands. Here is a thud of impact. Here is a perfectly placed wound. Here is puncturing vein and sheep\u2019s eyes dying and a second scream, third scream, fourth scream because now the woman is screaming. She should have been old enough to leave.\u00a0\n\tThe man recovers quicker this time, watch. Now both a mother and her daughter are dead, not just one, and things seem more in balance.\u00a0Wretched mirrors and all that. \n\tHe stands up and brushes the carnival dew off his carnival suit.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou can take them both if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\tThe woman is shocked. Watch her face in the moonlight; she\u2019s older than she\u2019ll tell you. Blame society, if you\u2019d like. But, then, she\u2019s not that old, so blame her histrionic personality, if that suits you better.\u00a0\n\t\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want you to do that!\u201d she says, almost a wail.\u00a0\n\t\u201cShe did.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cThe \n told you-\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cI was trying to be better.\u201d\u00a0\n\tYou\u2019ve remembered the point of all of this, haven\u2019t you?\u00a0\n\tThe dark-haired woman purses her lips.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t run this stand, then.\u201d\u00a0\n\tHe wasn\u2019t expecting this. He drops his voice.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI know. I-\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cActually, I will take both. The lamb and the sheep. Please.\u201d\u00a0\n\tHe falls silent, looks at her as a betrayer.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m under no obligation to be better myself.\u201d she says, impatient.\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt\u2019ll be ten extra-\u201d\u00a0\n\tSeriously?\u00a0\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0\n\tThank God.\u00a0\n\tHe nods.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI can bag them myself.\u201d says the woman.\u00a0\n\tShe\u2019s not really asking but she\u2019s not really telling. I don\u2019t know. You decide, but remember it\u2019s not terribly important.\u00a0\n\tHe nods and they walk over to the booth together, both trying very hard not to look back at the two white bodies lying in the grass that is rapidly becoming crusted, not dripping, with blood.\u00a0\n\t\u201cDo you mind if I leave you to it?\u201d he says eventually, sticking a fork through the porridgey silence.\u00a0\n\t\u201cNot at all.\u201d\u00a0\n\tA few more paces from both of them.\u00a0\n\t\u201cThere are plastic bags in the cupboard under the cash register. Don\u2019t, um, take any money.\u201d\u00a0\n\tThis man is remarkably tactless.\u00a0\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d\u00a0\n\tHa.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWell, they\u2019re my wages.\u201d\u00a0\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone with your cash register, then.\u201d\u00a0\n\tHere is a woman with a point.\u00a0\n\tHere is a man averting his eyes as she walks behind the booth.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d he says, darkly serious. He looks at her with deep distrust. The woman remembers her mother and she also remembers the opened but uneaten bag of granola she has at home, which is going to go stale if she doesn\u2019t do something with it, maybe trail mix or cookies or just breakfast.\u00a0\n\t\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get the bags, then I\u2019ll leave too.\u201d\u00a0\n\tShe knows he wants to hear that she understands. It helps with trusting sometimes. You understand.\u00a0\n\tHere is a man turning away. Here is a man passing the bodies of a mother and a daughter and trying not to slip on the wet grass. Here is a man walking towards the lights of a carnival, and getting on a ferris wheel, and watching a woman as she does exactly as promised. She\u2019s quick and neat bagging the sheep. Her blue scarf blows in the wind. Her skin is golden in the infant sunrise. He feels nothing.\u00a0\n\tHere is a man who is thinking about sailing to France, and the sheep in the fields of Old England, and not working in a carnival for the rest of his life.\u00a0\n\tHere is a story about someone trying to become a better person.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Just Playing", "story": "Just Playing\n \nSimon peddled his bike through the woods, bumping crazily over the deeply rutted dirt path.\u00a0He sped up as the path elevated to a gently sloping grade.\u00a0His legs pumped in a blur like insane locomotive wheels.\u00a0He laughed maniacally.\n \n\tHis ape-hangered blue steed galloped over the earth fleet-footedly.\u00a0The stallion was named Whiteboots of Lightening, Boots for short, named for his white-walled tires.\u00a0In his mind\u2019s eye Boots was of course not blue, how silly would \n be?\u00a0Childish to believe in a \n horse\u2026\n stallion was sleek shiny black, like the one in that famous story\u2026only his had white feet and a lightening shaped white blaze on his forehead.\u00a0\n \n\tHis little sister Mavis (who would always be Sissy, or Sissy-Pants to him, cuz she hated it) used to have yellow streamers on the handlebars of her little green tricycle.\u00a0She rode past Simon one day and he noticed how they waved and fluttered\u2026like a horse\u2019s tail. He had easily outrun her, grabbed her handlebars to stop her, and yanked the streamers out from the rubber handles.\u00a0She had cried, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d\u00a0He had laughed and run to their garage where Boots was waiting for his new tail.\n \n \n \n \n\tThe path ahead narrowed and flame colored maple leaves crowded the tunnel.\u00a0It was like sailing through a ring of fire, or a portal to hell.\u00a0As he soared through, he shouted, \u201cGo Boots, c\u2019mon boy!\u201d Simon\u2019s heart was pumping fast, fluttering like a bird\u2019s\u2026\n\tA second later, there was no earth under Simon\u2019s wheels (Boots\u2019 hooves)- he was airborne!\n\t\u201cWhoo hooooo!\u201d\n\tA \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 jump, as exciting as a roller coaster; every time he sped up the dirt path as it rose, his goal was to catch more air and sail farther.\u00a0\n\tSimon\u2019s back wheel landed first. The front tire above his head.\u00a0A poof of pale dust clouded behind him and whisped into the breeze.\n\t\u201cAh yeah!\u201d He fisted the air.\u00a0His bike continued down the slope to the river on autopilot.\n\tDown at the river, Simon dumped his bike and re-lived the mega-jump.\u00a0\n He decided to ask Stan if he wanted to play the next day even though he thought the scrawny kid was a total dork; a dork who just got a Go-Pro for his birthday.\u00a0Simon often picked on him in school.\u00a0He did so out of jealousy because Stan was so darn smart.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n\tThey\u2019d built a fort together about a month ago, with lumber they\u2019d pilfered from one of the many construction sites at the edge of town.\u00a0Instead of dragging only long flat boards into the woods with Simon\u2019s Radio Flyer, Stan had grabbed smaller scraps of two by fours as well.\u00a0Simon had scoffed but when they were finished, the new fort was a hundred times cooler than any Simon had ever built before, looking more like a pirate ship than a whino\u2019s shack.\u00a0Stan brought a jolly roger flag and his Go-Pro, Simon brought Bruce, Sissy\u2019s favorite teddy bear, as a sacrifice to Neptune when they christened their new ship.\u00a0\n\tSissy had discovered the kidnapping shortly after the crime was committed, as Bruce was never far from her gravity, and ran into the woods after them.\u00a0They weren\u2019t hard to find, she followed the sounds of their laughter and discovered the ship.\u00a0At the end of a four-foot plank was Bruce.\u00a0The teddy was slumped over the edge of the plank, limp because half his stuffing was torn out, it lay in clumps like a small snowdrift under the board.\u00a0Sissy had screamed when she found Bruce\u2019s head under the fluffy white stuffing.\u00a0She had dropped it in horror as if it was covered in blood.\u00a0Then she had run to the bear\u2019s body, but Simon had stopped her with his pirate\u2019s sword (plastic light saber) \u201cNot so fast wench.\u00a0The first mate is a goner.\u00a0Attacked by a fierce hungry tiger he was!\u00a0Yar\u2026a huge tiger\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cB-b-but this a ship.\u201d She\u2019d pointed a pudgy finger at the flag.\u00a0\u201cP-p-pirate ship.\u201d\n\t\u201cYar! We were taking the tiger to a zoo.\u00a0Yar.\u00a0He escaped his cage and blammo!\u00a0Rip rip rip! Too late to be saved, we really tried, honest we did.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u00a0He never did anything to you, you big meany!\u201d\n\tStan had had the decency to look ashamed.\u00a0He was an only child and not accustomed to hearing little girls cry.\u00a0He\u2019d plucked the limp raggedy body off the plank and tossed it at Sissy.\u00a0It flopped against her heaving chest then fell to the ground.\u00a0As she picked it up, Simon said, \u201cAw take yer dumb bear, we were done with it anyways.\u201d\u00a0He had picked up the head and hurled it at her, nailing her square in the forehead.\u00a0\n\tShe\u2019d snitched that night to their mom.\u00a0He\u2019d made her pay.\u00a0It had been the last time she\u2019d snitched.\n \n \n \n \n \n\tNow, at the river, he daydreamed about adding a ramp to his jump, and that made him think of building another fort, a spaceship maybe.\u00a0Days spent building a fort were as great as the ones catching tadpoles, better in fact, since he had yet to have a taddy survive long enough to become an awesome frog.\u00a0\n \u201cha ha!\u201d he laughed out loud. He thought himself a kind boy, one who never failed to say a little eulogy with every flush of the toilet handle.\u00a0\n \n\tWith a ramp he could catch even more air!\u00a0He rubbed his dirty hands together like Mr. Evil Snidely after tying the damsel to the railroad track.\u00a0\n \n\tMr. Evil Snidely was a character in his cast that he played when his pals were not able to come over.\u00a0The scenario was one in which he tormented Sissy-Pants; the victim, one of her dollies.\u00a0\n\u00a0Sissy was kept in her place by the threat of decapitation of the poor helpless damsel, \n\u00a0Then he'd gallop across the neatly mown lawn (He wasn\u2019t allowed to play noisy games in the house- no trains, cowboys, galloping anything) and duck around the corner of the house.\u00a0\n\u2026 Then he\u2019d come galloping back in his faux beaver-felt cowboy hat or his moth-eaten racoon cap, complete with bushy tail ringed in black stripes.\u00a0\n\tIn the mini-Stetson-esque one he was Rock Courage, Sheriff of Schmittville, blazing in to save the day with his shiny silver revolver held high to ward off any Injuns lookin to make a meal of the struggling distressed damsel on the tracks.\u00a0\n\tIf he galloped back in the raccoon cap, he was Doc Courage, Rock\u2019s equally handsome brother.\u00a0Doc was an explorer who passed through town on occasion or when called upon to rescue some poor babe in danger of losing a limb to leprosy or some other such rare and horrible disfiguring affliction, he was, after all, the most highly acclaimed doctor in all the land, Schmittville and beyond.\u00a0And if the patient was beyond curing, he\u2019d put it down with a blast from his trusty Red Ryder, loaded with monster exploding bullets, equally good for ridding the land of those pesky injuns.\u00a0In either scenario, the weeping old Miz Sissypants, would inevitably be knocked to the ground in the fallout.\u00a0\n\tJust last week they\u2019d played, and he had said, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare go crying to Mom.\u201d \n\tHer face had screwed up, red cheeks puffed like apples, the steam building in her panting chest, ready to let go an ear-shattering wail\u2026only the screams of a little girl stomping in frustration could reach such high-pitched heights\u2026ears bled, and dogs ran for the hills. At last, the air in her balloon cheeks had escaped in a thin wheeze.\u00a0She had stamped her little Mary Janes and cried, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u00a0You\u2019re bigger than me!\u201d\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u00a0I am.\u201d\u00a0He had pushed her and when she landed on her bottom he added, \u201cGet used to it.\u00a0I\u2019ll always \nbigger than you.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n\tHe sat by the river; it was cool and clear amidst the reeds and cattails.  He was stoked to beat his air record.\u00a0The day was perfect.\u00a0He put his hands behind his head and was about to lay back and look at the clouds and think about his ramp.\n \n\tA movement on the other side of the river caught his eye.\n \n\tHe sat up straight and realized a kid was sitting across the river, leaning against the sloping grassy bank, just as he had been, a red bicycle lay on its side beside him.\u00a0How had Simon not noticed?\u00a0It was as if he\u2019d popped out of thin air.

The face had bright yellow eyes with cat-like pupils.\n \n\tSimon said, \u201cRad bike dude!\u00a0Did yer pops make it for you?\u201d\n\t\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n \n\tSandy pulled ahead as the path narrowed and descended downwards.\n \n\tSimon said, \u201cHey, this is a great hill!

At one point a truly terrifying space creature was getting the best of Robot, Sandy was laughing, Simon was terrified. By the end of it, Simon was beginning to think there was a screw loose in Sandy\u2019s head.\u00a0\n \n\tAfter the episode, Sandy said, \u201cWanna see my room?\u201d\n\t\u201cSure.\u201d\n \n\tThe walls of Sandy\u2019s room were plastered with outer space posters: The Milky Way, the constellations, the earth from afar, and more than a dozen of a planet he thought must be Venus or Pluto.\u00a0He found it odd because it was so plain looking, not like Saturn, or the giant, Jupiter.\u00a0The posters were top quality and looked like genuine photographs.\n \n\tSimon said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u00a0It\u2019s kinda boring.\u201d\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s Proxima.\u00a0It\u2019s not boring at all, its atmosphere is very much like earth\u2019s.\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve nev---\u201d\n\tJust then a high-pitched squeal volted out from behind them.\u00a0Simon whirled and searched for its source.\n\tSandy said, \u201cThat\u2019s Sid.\u00a0He\u2019s just hungry.\u201d\n \n\tThey went to a glass tank on the desk by the window.\u00a0Sid was a gerbil.\u00a0\n\tWith six beady black eyes...\nAnd a mouth full of needle-like teeth.\u00a0It gnashed them together and drooled.\u00a0Every eye was focused on Simon.\u00a0It stood up on its hind legs and walked like a human to the glass.\u00a0Simon saw four more legs dangling from its pudgy body.\u00a0It shrieked and clawed at the glass as if trying to dig its way out.\u00a0Simon backed away until he felt something hard and pointy pressing into his back.\n \n\tHe turned around.\u00a0Sandy was holding the coolest toy ray-gun Simon had ever seen. \u00a0Impossibly, Sandy was now two inches taller than Simon.\u00a0He grinned wide, ear to ear, his teeth were slick grey like varnished pewter, and \u2026\n\u00a0Simon backed away, confused.\u00a0Sandy pointed the ray-gun at the floor and fired it.\u00a0A blinding green-white beam shot from its tip, and a smoking black hole the size of a silver dollar appeared an inch from Simons left toe.\n\tHe only took his eyes off Sandy for a second, when he looked at him again, the thing that was not a boy at all was now four inches taller than him.\u00a0Sandy laughed. \n\tIt was the laugh of a little girl.\u00a0Simon\u2019s blood went icy as the thing started chanting, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026it\u2019s not fair\u2026it\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d\n \n\tSimon turned and ran like he\u2019d never run before.\n \n\tOutside, it was just after sunset, cold, and darkening fast.\u00a0He lifted the thing\u2019s bike from the grass and pedaled faster than he ever had before, the bike was lightning fast!\n \n\tThrough the woods he raced.\u00a0In minutes he was at the slope.\u00a0The bike didn\u2019t slow as it ascended.\u00a0It went even faster.\u00a0It sailed off the top\u2026and upwards\u2026high.\u00a0The saddle between his thighs was warm.\u00a0It expanded and contracted.\u00a0\n\tBreathing.\u00a0\n.\u00a0\n\tFrom under the saddle wings unfurled.\u00a0They were membranous like a bat\u2019s, almost see-through, and runnelled with thick veins.\u00a0From before him, a barking sound erupted.\u00a0\n\tLaughter.\u00a0\n\tHe was flying over the pine forest. The whooshing of the wings was like wind from a giant bellows.\u00a0His eyes watered fiercely. \n\t\u201cPlease.\u00a0Please let me down.\u201d\n\t\u201cArk ark ark ark!\u201d\n \n\tThey flew low over the suburban neighborhood- his neighborhood.\u00a0Over his yard, the living, flying thing flipped over and sent him sprawling downward.\u00a0The land met him fast and hard.\u00a0He whumped onto the grass on his back, the wind knocked out of him.\n \n\tFrom miles away, he heard his sister calling his name.\n\tThen she was there looking down at him. \u201cWhatchoo doin down there silly-pants?\u00a0Mom\u2019s been callin you for supper.\u00a0You\u2019re in troooo-bell\u2026heeeeey, what dat?\u201d\n\t\u201cFor you Mavis, it\u2019s a gummy.\u201d\n\t\u201cOoooh, tank you Simy.\u201d\u00a0He reverently placed the squished eyeball in her pale little hand.\n \n "}
{"title": "Don't You Remember", "story": "\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u00a0Can you even see when you are sleepwalking?\u201d\n\u201cI am trying to remember officer, but it is difficult.\u00a0My eyes can see when I sleepwalk, but I am not really very aware of what is around me. My mind generates images that my eyes don\u2019t actually see.\u00a0I once fell down the stairs in my sleep, picked myself up, and headed back to bed.\u00a0When I awoke I was quite surprised by the blood on my pillow.\u00a0My mother wasn\u2019t though.\u00a0She had heard me fall, got up and apparently she guided me back to bed, and washed the first flow of blood from my head.\u00a0That is what she told me anyway, and I had no reason to not believe her. .\u00a0I must have been able to see.\u00a0Otherwise I would not have been able to get back up the stairs without falling again.\u201d\u201d \n\u201cWhat do you recall then from your walk in the woods last night?\u00a0Anything come to mind?\u201d\n\u201cI do recall dreaming about running in a race in the track in my old high school.\u00a0I often dream about that as I was on the track team.\u201d\n\u201cAnything other than just that sir?\u201d\n\u201cWell, as I told the other officer on the phone this morning, when I heard the news about the little girl that went missing, I do have a picture in my mind of seeing a little girl with very long hair that was a bright red.\u00a0She looked kind of like a slightly younger version of Anne of Green Gables.\u00a0I told the other officer that I was not completely sure that was what I saw.\u00a0My wife and I had recently been on vacation on Prince Edward Island, and visited the home of the author of the book, Lucy Maude Mongomery.\u201d\n\u201cNow did you see anyone else standing close to her?\u201d\n\u201cWell, officer, this might sound strange, but I think that I saw something that looked a lot like a bear.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no bears in these woods, sir. You are a visitor here I understand, staying at one of the hotels on main street.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true officer.\u00a0But now that I am putting more thought into that sleep-walking vision.\u00a0I believe that what I might have been looking at was a fairly big man with a thick brown coat on.\u201d\n\u201cNow we are getting somewhere.\u00a0I will call the little girl\u2019s mother, to see if she knows such a man.\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2019am, this is officer Jenkins.\u00a0I have been talking with the man who thinks that he saw your daughter last night, and called us when he heard the report on the radio,.\u00a0Now this is going to sound like a very strange question, but I want to know whether you know a big man with a brown coat.\u201d\nThere is a brief silence as the woman contemplates the question.\n\u201cWell, I used to know a big man, my ex-husband.\u00a0I don\u2019t know about the brown coat though.\u00a0I never saw him wear one, but we have been separated for two years now.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know where he lives now, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid that I do not know that.\u00a0We haven\u2019t communicated with each other in months.\u00a0And he was never one to do much in the way of providing information.\u201d\n\u201cWell, give us his name, and any other information that might prove useful in finding him.\u201d\n\u201cHis name is Christ Jenkins, but I don\u2019t even know his current cell phone number.\u201d\n\u201cOkay ma\u2019am, we\u2019ll see what we can find out about him.\u00a0If you can think of anything else, just give us a call.\u201d\nOnce his conversation with the police officer was finished, the sleep-walker headed back to his hotel room.\u00a0He was anxious to tell his wife about how his sighting of the little girl has proceeded.\u00a0He knew that she would want to know everything.\u00a0He was also searching through his mind for a reasonably accurate picture of the man who looked like a bear when he first envisioned him.\u00a0He had no luck in that regard, but he would keep on trying.\nHe and his wife had dinner, the table talk being all about his sleepwalking adventure, his conversation with the police officer, and his still failing attempts to conjure up a clearer image of the \u2018man who was a bear\u2019.\u00a0His wife asked some good questions, but he still was a few answers short of being definite.\nThat night he hoped that he would do no more sleepwalking, but there was a restlessness in him that sometimes would be followed by his late night wandering.\u00a0Sure enough, not long before midnight, still dressed in his dark blue pajamas, he got up and began the zombie-style walking like he had engaged in the night before.\u00a0He passed by a few people who stared in dumb wonder, but did not say anything, thinking that he was probably drunk or stoned.\nHe went out the back door, as he had the last time.\u00a0Again, like the previous night, he proceeded through the parking lot\u00a0\u00a0But this time he saw something before he hit the trail to the woods that he had travelled on before.\u00a0He again spotted the bear, but this time he rapidly changed into the figure of a big man wearing a brown jacket. The man was carrying something in both of his arms.\u00a0The sleepwalker saw the red hair again.\u00a0The difference this time was that the shock of sighting both man and child once more woke him up to where his mind saw clearly what his eyes beheld.\nHe turned around sharply, but not before he got a good look at the number on the front license plate of the car the backseat of which the man was placing the little girl\u00a0\u00a0Then he moved quickly to and through the back door, heading for the reception desk.\u00a0He took a chance and asked the male receptionist to call 911, but not before he told him, \u201cI have just seen the little girl that disappeared.\u00a0She is being kidnapped\u2019.\u00a0Fortunately, the receptionist overlooked that the man asking him to do this was in his pajamas, and did what he was asked to do.\u00a0He was new at the job and did not want to anger a guest.\nThe sleepwalker got on the phone, and told the officer on the line who he was and that he had seen the kidnapper about to escape, taking the little girl with him.\u00a0Guided by the license number, the police were soon on the scene and caught up with the man and the child.\u00a0\nThe radio report the next day said that the man was the girl\u2019s father, and that she had been rescued with the brave assistance of a tourist staying at a local hotel.\u00a0No mention was made of his sleepwalking or of his dark blue pajamas."}

{"title": "Gabriel", "story": "The cat with the ebony coat and pale green eyes sat on the fence post next to an elm tree where a family of squirrels lived.\u00a0The cat\u2019s name was Gabby, and the squirrels were his closest friends.\n \n\tJeremy, a fluffy-tailed grey squirrel, climbed down the elm to the branch closest to the fence.\u00a0He said, \u201chey Gab, have you seen Juniper?\u201d Juniper was Jeremy\u2019s sister.\u00a0He had two younger sisters and an older brother.\u00a0There had been six siblings at one time.\n \n\tGabby said, \u201cNope.\u00a0She\u2019s probably up in the oaks with Jersey collecting acorns.\u201d\n\tJeremy said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u00a0Mom\u2019s kinda freakin cuz of \u2026you know\u2026\u201d\n \n\tGabby did know.\u00a0Jeripoo had disappeared the month before and the family was still unnerved and on edge and sad.\u00a0Squirrels are at the bottom of the food chain so as much as \u2018the Js\u2019 parents mourned their losses, they accepted the fact that the woods were full of the claws, teeth, and the hungry bellies of animals much larger than them.\n \n\t\u201cHey, you guys wanna play hide and seek?\u201d\u00a0A voice called down from the elm.\u00a0It was Joey, Jeremy\u2019s brother.\u00a0\n\t\u201cSure!\u201d\u00a0said Gabby.\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re the seeker first!\u201d shouted Jeremy.\u00a0He and Joey scampered down the tree and into the woods.\n\tGabby cried after them, \u201cbut I\u2019m always the first!\u201d\n\t\u201cHa!\u00a0That\u2019s cuz you\u2019re a slowpoke!\u201d \u00a0shouted Jeremy, laughing.\n\tGabby counted to ten as he watched the squirrels\u2019 tails disappear through the bushes.\n \n\tAfter the count, he took off through the same bushes.\u00a0He looked around for signs of their passage: grey fur caught on sharp twigs perhaps, or fine disturbed dust motes in the air.\u00a0He studied a clump of raspberry bushes and saw a couple of ripe, red berries on the ground.\u00a0\n\u2019 he thought and darted through the prickly bushes.\u00a0\n\tAn obnoxious blue jay squawked ahead.\u00a0Gabby ran towards the noise, the tuft-headed birds always freaked out when squirrels frolicked their way.\n \n\tThrough a clearing and into a grove of oak trees, Gabby ran.\u00a0He skidded to a stop at the base of the tallest one. There was a hollow about ten feet up the trunk.\u00a0\n\tGabby thought, \n\u2019\u00a0He jumped and clawed up to the inky black burrow and thought, \u2018\n\u2019\u00a0Out loud he shouted, \u201cHere I come!\u201d\u00a0And leapt through the opening.\u00a0\n\tIt was deep.\u00a0So deep, in fact, that he fell in pitch blackness a very long way.\u00a0\n\tHe feared he would fall forever.\u00a0Maybe all the way to China.\n\tJust before seriously panicking, the tunnel curved upwards slightly, and he was thrown out of an opening and into the middle of no-where.\u00a0He sailed upwards into a star filled night sky as if he had wings.\u00a0He gawped in amazement at the earth far below as wispy clouds breezed by. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018\n,\u2019 he thought as looked down upon trees and moonlit meadows.\u00a0Though he\u2019d dreamt of flying many times and always regretted waking from those wonderful dreams, this time felt so \n\tThe stars all around him sparkled like diamonds.\u00a0The moon was the shape of a slender crescent and wispy pale mist swirled around the tops of the trees.\u00a0His eyes were like night vision goggles, they were agog with the sights around him. The pleasant scent of a cook fire wafted his way. He looked down and spotted a lone cabin, the smoke drifting up from its chimney, and warm amber lighting emitting from its windows.\n\tGabby was drawn downwards by a magnetic pull. \u00a0His paws landed on the ground as silently as feathers.\u00a0This place felt magical.\u00a0Even the coming storm clouds were a beautiful work of art, as mysterious and colorful as a Van Gogh painting.\n\tGabby slinked to the window by the door.\u00a0On tippy toes, he peered into the cabin and saw a cozy living room with crackling flames in a stone wall-to-ceiling fireplace.\u00a0An iron pot hung over the fire.\u00a0A woman came into the room, she was draped in a dark woolen shawl.\u00a0She wore flowy purple pants and short Ugg boots.\u00a0\n\tA rumble of thunder suddenly rolled over the cabin.\u00a0\n\tGabby looked to the sky and saw bluey-grey clouds swirling like misty phantoms.\u00a0\n\tHe looked back to the window\u2026\n\tA flash of lightening lit the window up\u2026 on the other side of the glass, mere inches from his face, was an ancient grotesque mummie\u2019s face, curtained with long white hair like straw. \u00a0Blueish lips parted in a wide grin, revealing teeth filed to sharp points. Gabby shrieked and fell backwards, his eyes bugging from his head.\u00a0He dared to look up.\u00a0In the illumination from the next lightning strike, the window was empty.\n\tGabby lay on his back and blinked as light rain pelted his face.\n\t\n,\u2019 he thought as he looked through the window again.        \tThe woman came out of the kitchen.\u00a0She was young and pretty, not old and creepy.\u00a0She crossed the living room and opened the front door.\u00a0\u201cWelcome little friend.\u00a0Would you like to come inside? Supper is ready and you look hungry.\u201d\n\tGabby\u2019s stomach rumbled.\u00a0It felt empty, like he hadn\u2019t eaten in days.\u00a0It was nighttime after all, and the aroma of beef stew wafted past his quivering nose.\u00a0He salivated and followed the woman inside in the sort of trance one only experiences in dreams.\n\tInside the homey cabin, Gabby said, \u201cYes.\u00a0Please. Who are you?\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Marjabelle\u2026 call me Marj.\u201d She giggled like a schoolgirl.\u00a0On closer inspection, she seemed about thirtyish.\u00a0She twirled as she went to the kitchen, her pale hair like cornsilk in a breeze, and her purple pantaloons rippling like flags on her slender legs.\n\tShe came back with a pair of bowls and went to the iron pot.\u00a0He said, \u201cI\u2019m Gabby---\u201d\n\tShe said, \u201cAs in Gabriel like the angel.\u201d\n\tGabby said, \u201cI suppose so.\" \n\tThe young woman filled the bowls with stew and placed them on the little wooden table where two place settings were set.\n\tGabby sat at the table across from Marjabelle. \n\tThe stew was the best he\u2019d ever tasted.\u00a0She was a master with herbs and seasonings.\u00a0The meat was tender, juicy, and gamey.\u00a0The carrots and turnips were soft and though Gabby wasn\u2019t a huge veggie fan, these were delicious.\u00a0When sated, Gabby said, \u201cI\u2019m confused by this place, here, where you live.\u00a0I\u2019ve been hallucinating crazy stuff\u2026\u201d\n\tMarj tittered prettily again.\u00a0\u201cThis is heaven.\u00a0Heaven on earth. \u00a0It\u2019s my own creation.\u00a0Any creature who makes it here experiences their own heaven. Many wish to fly.\u201d She winked at him.\n\t\u201cWhy?\u00a0Why do you do this?\u201d\n\t\u201cThe hollow tree is the only portal. I don\u2019t fit through it\u2026\u201d\u00a0She shrugged and her smile turned sad.\n\tGabby said, \u201cYou\u2019re trapped here\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been here for four hundred and thirty-seven years.\u00a0It\u2019s another dimension, invisible from earth\u2019s dimension, the one you\u2019re from.\u00a0My father put me here.\u00a0He was a powerful sorcerer but mad, quite literally mad.\u201d She pointed at her head and cocked it a bit.\u00a0She was awfully glib for someone trapped in another dimension.\n\tMarj noted the alarmed look on Gabby\u2019s face and said, \u201cOh, you are free to come and go, don\u2019t worry.\u00a0If you fit through the tree, you\u2019re good.\u00a0You\u2019ll never find a mastiff or a donkey in here.\u201d\n\tGabby remained uneasy, the alarm bells in his head clanged like a firetruck\u2019s.\n\tMarj said, \u201cdid you like your heaven?\u201d\n\t\u201cWow. It truly was my heaven.\u201d\n\t\u201cI know.\u00a0I\u2019ve had many visitors, through the tree portal, over the years and it became my pastime\u2026my art\u2026my, um, I dunno\u2026a way to make others happy.\u00a0Doing that makes \n happy.\u201d\n\t\u201cI should be going home.\u00a0It\u2019s so late\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cActually, you\u2019ll find when you go back through the tree only ten minutes has passed.\u201d\n \n***\n \nIt was true.\n\tGabby clawed his way up inside the tree (it was only ten feet again) and came out into a chilly March day.\u00a0Grey, overcast, a little damp\u2026\n\u2019 He felt a pang of regret\u2026he already missed his \u2018heaven\u2019.\n\tHe went home and wondered if the squirrels had worried about him.\u00a0\u2018\n\tGabby\u2019s head was spinning, and his belly was full.\u00a0He crawled into bed for a nap and slept as if he\u2019d been up a week and run a marathon.\n \n\tEarly the next morning, when the day was still purple-pink, the squirrels started shrieking.\u00a0Gabby raced to their tree.\u00a0Momma Squirrel was wringing her tiny paws and weeping while her babies consoled her with eyes full of sorrow and tears.\u00a0\n\tGabby said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d\n\tJoey said, \u201cJuniper never came home last night.\u201d\n\tGabby had a thought\u2026one that curdled his blood and made his stomach fold over on itself.\u00a0He told his wee friends that he was going out to search for Juniper even though he was pretty sure he knew she was lost forever.\n\t\u201cHey, you want me to come with you?\u201d It was Joey, the bravest of the siblings.\n\t\u201cNo!\u201d\n\tJoey cringed and Gabby felt bad, he said, \u201cI\u2019m faster on my---\u201d\n\t\u201c---But I\u2019m faster than you\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cNo!\u00a0Please.\u00a0Let me use my catness to search for your sister.\u201d He knew exactly where to go and couldn\u2019t risk Momma Squirrel losing another of her babies.\n\tJoey eyeballed Gabby a few seconds then nodded.\u00a0\u201cFine.\u201d\n \n \n\tGabby silently made his way back to the enormous tree with his ears on high alert.\u00a0Squirrels were very sneaky but not so stealthy, their claws made tiny \n noises as they dug into tree limbs and bark.\u00a0Every time he heard a squirrel his hopes rose\u2026but none were his wee friend.\n\tHe dove into the hollow and eventually came out the other side into his sanctuary\u2026\n\u2019\u00a0It was as before- he exited the tree and flew in the starry sky.\u00a0Though he would have loved to fly for hours, he was on a mission.\u00a0He made his way to the cabin and peeked into the living room window.\u00a0No witch in sight.\u00a0He saw that the back door in the kitchen was ajar and cautiously circled the cabin to it.\n\tThe cabin was as cozy as before, with a fire in the hearth and the welcoming scents of onions, herbs, and rich, meaty gravy. \u00a0Gabby\u2019s mouth watered involuntarily.\u00a0He scolded himself and felt ashamed.\n\tHis sharp ears detected no one in the cabin.\n\tHe crossed the living room and peeked into the pot hanging in the hearth.\n\tA small white skull bobbed to the surface as he watched. \n\tThe kitchen door slammed shut!\n\tHe whirled around and the witch was there!\u00a0\u201cHello there nosy kitty.\u201d\u00a0She stepped towards Gabby, and he stepped away.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill you.\u00a0I enjoy your company.\u00a0I even thought perhaps you\u2019d like to be my familiar\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cNever!\u00a0You\u2019ve been eating my friends!\u201d\n\t\u201cYeah, well, a gal\u2019s gotta eat.\u201d\u00a0She shrugged her shoulders.\u00a0\u201cBut you liked flying right?\u00a0Stay with me and you can fly any time you want to.\u201d\n\t\u201cI could never trust you!\u00a0I saw what you really are\u2026\u201d\n\tMarj\u2019s eyes narrowed, and her lips tightened whitely. She lunged at the cat with her thin white fingers curled like the talons of an eagle.\u00a0She screamed like one too.\n\tGabby dodged unexpectantly towards her instead of away and the witch stumbled.\n\tShe screeched as she whirled around.\u00a0A wicked grin cracked her face from ear to ear, revealing glistening pointed teeth, as the black tail vanished around the corner and into the kitchen.\n\tAs the witch raced into the kitchen, the cat knocked over the broom by the fridge directly into Marj\u2019s path.\u00a0It caught her in the shins.\u00a0\u201cAAA!\u201d \u00a0She stumbled to the linoleum, her head whumping into a cabinet.\u00a0\u201cOh no! Ohhh no.\u00a0I don\u2019t \n so.\u201d\u00a0She leapt to her feet and grabbed the cleaver from the knife block on the counter.\u00a0As she exited the kitchen, she said, \u201cSay night-night my furry friend.\u201d\n\tThe cabin was small and offered few hiding places.\u00a0She looked around for signs of disturbance. She scanned the interior and sniffed the air.\n\tGabby thought, \u2018\n.\u2019 \n\tHe was hidden at the base of the coatrack by the door, concealed by a long velvet cloak.\u00a0He noticed the window over the credenza on the other side of the door.\u00a0It was open about six inches.\u00a0A tight squeeze but his only option.\u00a0His eyes flicked towards the fireplace as a shadow passed over the cauldron.\u00a0She was heading back towards the kitchen.\u00a0He chanced a peak out from under the cloak.\n\tGabby took what might be his only chance.\u00a0He raced to the credenza but before he jumped onto it a black booted foot caught him in his side with a sickening crunch (not Uggs this time, but leather with pointy toes.)  He went sprawling under it instead.\n\tMarj yanked him out by his tail. Every breath hurt, it felt like every rib was broken.\n\t\u201cAww, poor kitty.\u201d Marj dropped the cleaver and wrapped her hands around the cat\u2019s neck. \u201cWanna watch the life seep out from your eyes.\u201d\n\tAnd she did.\n \n \n\tThe witch was singing as she added more wood to the fire. Her voice lilted into the kitchen where Gabby lay unbreathing on the counter by the sink.\u00a0\n \n\tAnd then he breathed.\u00a0And listened.\u00a0The song was familiar, an old classic rock tune. \u2018\n\u2019 he thought as he came back to life.\n\tAs Gabby lay, pretending to be dead, he felt strength building in his limbs\u2026limbs he was very happy to still have attached to his torso.\u00a0His nerves thrummed with energy like live wires.\u00a0Warmth spread through his deathly cold body.\u00a0Over his head the kitchen window was open halfway.\u00a0Gabby invoked every silent, stealthy cat gene in him and slipped out of the window as silent as a ghost.\n \n\tAt the tree, he looked up and wished he could fly again.\u00a0He scrabbled up its bark and heard the THUNK of the cleaver whacking the bark an inch below his tail.\n \n\t\u201cFFFLLLYYYY!\u201d\u00a0shouted a voice from nowhere.  It was one he\u2019d never heard before.\u00a0Deep and reassuring.\n\tGabby grabbed an ounce of faith and pushed off the trunk into the air.\u00a0\n\tHe flew.\n\tHe didn\u2019t have the luxury of enjoying the flight. He heard a lengthy screech of frustration from down below as he entered the mysterious tree tunnel.\n \n \n\tOn his side of the world, he looked around and sighed a breath of relief.\u00a0The feeling didn\u2019t last long. A voice- the same that had commanded him to fly- said, \u201cGabriel.\u00a0There\u2019s something you need to know.\u201d\n\tGabby looked back at the tree and spotted an unnatural pale blue light where he\u2019d just exited.\u00a0It expanded and pulsed as if it had a heartbeat.\u00a0The light floated down towards him. He stared in wonder as the glow took the shape of an elderly, ruggedly handsome bearded man.\u00a0He turned to flee but the light man said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u00a0I am here to help you.\u00a0You could say I\u2019m your guardian angel.\u201d\u00a0He laughed warmly.\u00a0Grandfatherly.\n\tGabby turned back and saw that the light emanating from the man dimmed considerably as his feet touched the ground.\n\t\u201cAre you the one who brought me back to life?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo.\u00a0No need to.\u00a0You are immortal.\u201d\n\tGabby\u2019s jaw dropped.\u00a0He instinctively knew the man spoke the truth.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI am Siris.\u00a0An angel like you once were in another lifetime.\u201d\n\t\u201cGabriel\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cYes.\u00a0The re-incarnate of Gabriel the angel.\u00a0Sent to earth for a purpose.\u00a0The flying was not the witch\u2019s doing, it was all you.\u201d\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019ve never flown before yesterday\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cDid you ever try?\u201d\n\t\u201cHm.\u00a0No.\u201d\n\tThe man spread his hands palms up, in a \u2018see, there you have it\u2019 gesture.\n\t\u201cIs my purpose to kill the witch?\u201d\n\t\u201cOh, no need for that.\u00a0Simply destroy the portal.\u00a0She\u2019ll live on forever as a vegetarian.\u201d\n\t\u201cHow can I destroy a tree?\u00a0I\u2019m just a cat\u2026\u201d\n\t\u201cYou were once an angel.\u00a0The King of Angels will grant you a wish\u2026at a cost.\u201d Siris paused a moment and Gabby knew what was coming.\n\tSiris continued, \u201cYes.\u00a0I can see that you understand.\u00a0You may only have that one wish- the closing of the witch\u2019s portal- in exchange for your heavenly gifts: flying and immortality.\u201d\n\tGabby said, \u201cI was happy before I met the witch.

It\u2019s been twenty years since I\u2019ve returned,\u201d he grabbed the bridge of his nose.\n \n\t\u201cWow, that is a long time,\u201d wiping his glasses against his shirt.\n \n\t\u201cSome things I just didn\u2019t want to relive.\u201d\n \n\t\n\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cI hate the landings,\u201d he grasped the belt against his chest with a python's grip. The plane began to violently shake and Ammon was turning paler by the second. A loud thud was heard as the wheels touched the desert sand. The captain opened the aircraft side door and ushered everyone out. Ammon stood at its exit staring into the vast dune sea trembling.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cI never thought I\u2019d come back to this place. I don\u2019t think I can go through with this,\u201d he turned away grabbing his backpack. David appeared beside him and placed his hand on his shoulder.\n \n\t\u201cIs that what Mallory would have wanted?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me what he would have wanted. You weren\u2019t there. You didn\u2019t see what I saw. What\u2019s out there can\u2019t be explained and you want me to just go back into the lion's den and for what? A silly promise given to me by some\u2026 thing?\u201d shoving David\u2019s hand off his shoulder. He looked at his bag with Mallory\u2019s name etched into it. Releasing a huge sigh he turned to the exit and stepped into the desert plain, \u201cFor your family.\u201d\n \n\tThe harsh desert wasted no time bearing its ruthless teeth on these travelers. Within minutes two members already returned to the aircraft with heatstroke. As the days passed not much comradery was formed as their chances of survival were at an all-time low and the desert constantly pushed them to their limits. They shared a tent at night to stay warm as the temperature dropped to freezing conditions and when they woke one morning they found that another person didn\u2019t make it. David was the first to say something, \u201cDamnit, a fucking nother one. What is with this desert? It\u2019s like it's purposely trying to keep us from getting to this treasure, Ammon.\u201d\n \n\tAmmon zipped his shrinking bag closed, \u201cI told you all that this is no ordinary trip. Things happen here that aren\u2019t natural. If you want me to be honest I think Lucca got it easy, in his sleep and quiet. The others weren\u2019t so lucky last time. I can still hear them screaming.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cYeah, I remember the stories. We better find this meeting place soon or there won\u2019t be any more of us left to meet this so-called \n.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cHey! Don\u2019t believe me if you want. I don\u2019t know what else to call it. Her. Whatever it, she is,\u201d strapping on his backpack, leaving with one final glare at David.\n \n\tThe day went on as they followed Ammon through the vast nothingness of the desert. Murmurs of disbelief that there were treasures to be found or even a \n circulated the group. Ammon ignored them as he had for the past twenty years. No one ever believed him so why would they start now? David was the only one who actually listened and put this band of misfits together for Ammon, and he never questioned why each person was willing to risk their life for this story.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cLook, Ammon, I know we set out on this journey to help Mallory\u2019s family, to help his granddaughter. The others are starting to talk and I just wanted you to know that I have your back,\u201d smiling towards Ammon showing his pearly white teeth. His glasses slipped off his crooked nose and fell beside his feet. Reaching into the sand he pulled his hand out quickly and placed his finger in his mouth. \u201cOww! Shit, that hurt.\u201d\n \n\tAmmon stared at David\u2019s feet and the others gathered around to see what had happened. \u201cOf course! The sand would have buried the wreckage. This is where I survived the plane crash. We\u2019re getting closer,\u201d he checked his compass, and without hesitation went further into the desert.\n \n\tSetting up camp at nightfall they all gathered around the campfire exchanging stories of their lives and what they would like to buy when they found this treasure. Ammon never chimed in, he just stared into the flames for hours. David looked to Ammon, furrowed his brow sitting beside him, \u201cYou okay Ammon?\u201d\n \n\tMoments passed in silence and David began to leave. \u201cIt was a night like this when it happened. Over in a flash and there I was, laying in this desert with blood-soaked clothes. I could still hear their screams as their burning bodies illuminated the night. I could barely move at this point. I searched for Mallory but just couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d reaching into his pocket he pulled out a butterfly pin. David studied the pin and returned his gaze to Ammon as he put it away.\n \n\t\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it, he was gone. We were just two kids looking for an adventure in the jungles of Africa. Explore the unknown and find treasures and relics never before seen. What a grand dream we held and it came crashing down as soon as we touched this sea of nightmares,\u201d he took out a flask and took a hard gulp.\n \n\t\u201cI found him a few days later, though I didn\u2019t recognize him at first. If it wasn\u2019t for his bag,\u201d his gaze shifted from the fire to the bag then searched for Davids\u2019s eyes, \u201che lay there in agony David.\u201d His eyes swelled with tears, \u201cMy best friend in the whole world who was there for me when my father beat my mother to death in a drunken rage. Do you know what that's like?\u201d David shook his head. Ammon took another hard gulp of the flask, \u201che asked if help was on the way. Of course, I had no idea and was praying that someone knew what happened. The captain had sent a distress signal, though being able to pinpoint our location was difficult as I found out later in my rescue. David, this desert isn\u2019t normal. Things are here that shouldn\u2019t be. Maybe, it\u2019s us that shouldn\u2019t be here. This pin was in his bag.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cSo why do you have it now? Wouldn\u2019t you have given it to his daughter?\u201d\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cShe gave it back to me as a reminder of the promise I gave to Mallory. I can\u2019t fail this time. I can\u2019t fail Mallory again. I will find this promised treasure and pay to save his granddaughters life. They have suffered too much in this life,\u201d he took the final gulp from the flask. Staring hard at David he took in a giant breath holding it for a moment. David backed away quickly ready to reach for his sweat rag anticipating drunken puke. As Ammon heaved out his breath violently he slouched over and fell asleep instantaneously. David stared bug-eyed, shook his head, and retired to the tent with the others.\n \n\t\u201cGYAH!\u201d Maurice was found pointing and shouting that something was in the sand. The others gathered beside him scanning the desert. \u201cI guess we are all a little spooked?\u201d David said as he patted Maurice\u2019s shoulder and went back into the tent.\n \n\t\u201cI know what I saw!\u201d the others just nodded whispering their disbelief and soon their memory of the event eroded. They gathered around Ammon, who was wrapped in a cocoon of blankets from head to toe, ready to depart.\n \n\t\u201cI can\u2019t believe he just slept through all of that.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cHas he always slept this heavy before?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cNo, but he is having a challenging time guys,\u201d David began to prod Ammon to life. Ammon's eyes searched the surroundings, squinting at those near to him. His eyes widened raising his hands to his face massaging it the same way you'd take a napkin and squish a bug beneath it. Clambering to his feet he gathered his things without a word. He stared at the compass waved to the crew and drudged onward into the dune sea once more.\n \n\t\u201cWhat is that Ammon?\u201d David was pointing into the distance. Putting his hands above his brow he noticed that there was a black dot flashing every few seconds.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cHmm, it\u2019s random so I don\u2019t think it's morse code,\u201d David was writing in his small journal.\n \n\tAmmon gave him a look of confusion, \u201cWhat? Stories for my kids one day.\u201d Ammon quickly squeezed his eyes and relaxed them as he turned back towards the black dot in the sand. \u201cI suggest we take caution, like I said we aren\u2019t the only things here and that could very well be the thing that took Mallory\u2019s life.\u201d\u00a0\n \n\tThe closer they got the wilder the dot seemed to move. As a tadpole grows its legs so did this dot. The dot now had arms and was splashing in and out of the sand like a dolphin. Their pace increased and they were whispering among one another trying to guess what it could be. Ammon was staring intently and didn\u2019t take notice of any question that was being asked of him.\n \n\t\u201cAmmon! What is that thing?\u201d David grabbed Ammon\u2019s arm. Jerking his arm back keeping his gaze among the creature, \u201cDavid, I\u2019m sure this is the monster that killed Mallory before I was saved by that \n.\u201d David\u2019s eyes darted back and forth towards the creature, \u201cWhoa! Are you sure?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cNo!\u201d reaching his arm out towards the group they all stopped.\n \n\tThe dot had stopped and a slender silhouette of a female-like figure stared directly at the group. It dove into the sand. The group took a step back searching the area.\n \n\t\u201cRemain calm and stay alert,\u201d drawing his hunter's knife Ammon lowered his stance.\n \n\tIt burst from the sand showering golden stars on the group. They covered their eyes and some let out wails of terror. \u201cHa ha ha, humans are so easy to scare,\u201d the creature said showing their sharp teeth. With only half of its body exposed from the sand, it was female-like in form only. Its skin was covered in scales that shimmered like gold and many of its joints had spike-like shapes that flexed as if it was breathing. The face was missing a nose and the navy blue hair was as slimy as it was shiny. Its black eyes with red pupils bounced around to see each person.\n \n\t\u201cAnsa, is that you?\u201d Ammon walked towards the \n.\u00a0\n \n\t\u201cSo you have finally returned as promised?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cI did, though I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019m only doing this for Mallory and to collect only enough to save his family.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cSuch a noble human, and since you did save my life I will lead you to our Oasis.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cLead the way, and stop staring, fellas,\u201d the group quickly picked up their jaws from the floor pretending to be looking at things in their bags. Ansa took a dive and their legs were seen with giant flippers where their feet should be and rainbow-colored fins that followed down the sides of its legs. The sand bulged as Ansa swam through the desert occasionally, playfully telling the group just how slow they were. David stayed very close to Ammon, \u201cCan we trust this thing?\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWe can, they saved me when I was on the verge of death, David. I had no one else to help me with Mallory and then it came along.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cOkay, if you say so. I can\u2019t believe something like this even exists. I can understand why no one would believe this. It\u2019s not something you can describe in believable words,\u201d pushing his eyebrows together and upward he let a soft smile reach Ammon.\n \n\tNight arrived eerily fast this day, and worried looks were exchanged as the crew noticed gathering around the campfire once more. Ansa had already made a nest of deep clay, dry plants, and sticks.\n \n\t\u201cSo, Ansa was it? How did Ammon save you?\u201d David moved to sit closer to them.\n \n\t\u201cAh, yes, I forget you humans are so tightly knit for companionship. Not something our kind tends to do. We only work together for food.\u201d\n \n\tBlurting quickly and loud Ammon spoke aggressively, \u201cNothing really to tell! I saved Ansa from some other creature and she took me to the oasis before I was rescued. There... Story over. Get some rest everyone.\u201d Ammon took a violent swig of his flask. David turned to face the \n, \u201cSo is that all that happened?\u201d\n \n\tWith an unsettling smile, \u201cIn short, yes that is what happened. I found your friend Ammon there with a companion who was in terrible shape. We were resting just like we are now when it attacked us.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWhat attacked you?\u201d the crew leaned in closer.\n \n\t\u201cPistrisvir. Very aggressive and lone hunters. Twice the size of my kind and took the companion very quickly before anything could be done. I was attacked and Ammon stabbed the creature in the head. It vanished and we never saw it again.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWow, how very lucky,\u201d the crew were praising and tapping Ammon on his arm and legs.\n \n\t\u201cYes, how so very lucky that you all did not have to watch someone you love die before you,\u201d silence filled the air. Their heads dropped in unison. \u201cI suggest we sleep and rest up.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cThat would be a wise idea,\u201d Ansa curled into their nest as they slowly closed their eyes.\n \n\tDavid put his journal into his bag and walked beside Ammon placing his hand on his shoulder as tears fell. Ammon didn\u2019t look back at him, only drinking from the flask. David choked the words \n before going to the tent.\n \n\tIn the early morning light, Ansa took the lead once more and the crew followed suit. The silence from the night before accompanied the group until Ansa raised their arm. \u201cThis is it! You all made it! How delightful.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWhat do you mean we made it Ansa, there is nothing here?\u201d Ammon stomped ahead of Ansa gesturing around them.\n \n\t\u201cDo you think this is a place that humans could find on their own? Otherwise, would you hunt us down and take all of our treasure for yourselves? For eons you humans have always done what you wanted and showed time and time again just how greedy you truly are.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cTruer words have never been spoken, Ansa.\u201d David shifted from foot to foot. \u201cBut we are here to help a fellow human friend. I was saved by Ammon who taught me that I wasn\u2019t alone after having my parents taken away so quickly due to a drunk driver.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cDavid.\u201d Ammon had only heard him speak of this once in his life.\n \n\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay Ammon, I just want Ansa to know that we are doing this for good.\u201d\n \n\t\u201cWhat a nice human you are and quite handsome. Your type has always been my favorite.\u201d\n \n\tBlushing, David rushed the words, \u201cThank you!\u201d\n \n\t\u201cSo how do we get into this oasis?\u201d said Ammon checking his compass.\n \n\t\u201cAh, yes, sorry I was caught up in something,\u201d she disappeared among the sand. A burst of sand flew towards the crew, and with increasing speed, Ansa could be seen swimming in a circle shape. The sky turned purplish grey and the field of view in front of them began to melt away revealing an oasis. The water was crystal clear and gold could be seen at the bottom of its lake. The crew walked to the water's edge.\n \n\t\u201cGo ahead and have a drink,\u201d Ansa dived into the pool.\n \n\tDavid and the others followed directions and began taking handfuls of water wastefully spilling and drinking to their heart's content. They collapsed sporadically.\n \n\t\u201cWhat's going on!\u201d shouted Ammon as he ran to their aid. Before he could reach David the sand exploded and before him stood a man-like creature with grey scales. Their face also had no nose and their giant teeth couldn\u2019t be contained. Beady black eyes stared into Ammon\u2019s. In a flash, the creature grabbed Ammon by the neck and held him into the air. His eyes filled with anger, \u201cAnsa, you promised me!\u201d\n \n\t\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I? But I also said that our kind only work together for food and the desert is a harsh place.\u201d\n \n\tWhen she spoke he realized that the creature holding him had a giant scar on his face, \u201cYou!\u201d The creature smiled, slowly unhinging their jaw until their mouth was larger than Ammon\u2019s head. His eyes widened and let out a scream before violently being interrupted. His head was severed in a single bite, \u201clet\u2019s hope it\u2019s not another twenty years before we eat again, shall we, Ansa?\u201d\n \n\tAnsa wiped the blood off her mouth and grinned.\n "}
{"title": "Nothing But Blue Skies", "story": "Your husband tells me you can\u2019t sleep.\nI explained to him--Is his name Frank?\u00a0I explained to Frank that it\u2019s not that you\u2019re not sleeping. It\u2019s that you\u2019re not sleeping \n. You\u2019re getting some sleep here and there whether you know it or not. The trouble is that it\u2019s of no quality. Sleep is like food--there\u2019s the good kind and the bad kind. You\u2019re getting potato chip sleep. You need carrot stick sleep. Did you ever show your children the food pyramid when they were younger? Not that it\u2019s any of my business what you did or didn\u2019t show your children. I never had children. I told myself if I was going to have children I would want nine girls. If I couldn\u2019t guarantee myself that I\u2019d have nine girls, I wouldn\u2019t bother at all. So I never bothered. I got a lot of sleep though.\nThat\u2019s just a little joke.\nMy mother used to beg me not to joke. She\u2019d say \u201cCrystal, you are my golden child. My gem. My Faberge egg. But you are not funny and never will be.\u201d\nShe had a talent for honesty.\nNow your husband, Frank--Is his name Frank?--He\u2019s at a hotel tonight. It\u2019ll just be you and me. I brought some yarn, because I\u2019m working on--I work on all kinds of little projects. I hope you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m making some blue. Isn\u2019t blue a lovely color? Everything I do, I opt for blue. Blue sweaters, blue blankets. I never had enough blue growing up. I didn\u2019t see colors until I was fourteen. It broke my heart. I\u2019d look at a fresh strawberry and it was no different than looking at a newspaper in terms of the aesthetic. On my fourteenth birthday, I was helping my father fix something on our roof. I had to help him, because both my brothers were scared of heights. I wasn\u2019t scared of anything. While I was up there, I felt a dizzy spell come over me. The next thing I know, I\u2019m down on the ground. My mother saw me come down right in front of the kitchen window. She screamed bloody murder. The scream was what woke me up. I opened my eyes, and what did I see?\nBlue.\nThese beautiful blue skies.\nFrom that moment on, I could see any color I wanted. My mother and father said it was a miracle. \n, I thought. Some girl who saw the world as dull and gray could suddenly see maroon and aqua. I thought miracles were supposed to be all about healing those who couldn\u2019t walk or saving the souls of the damned. I felt selfish. An entire miracle wasted on me being able to appreciate a blue sky. My mother told me not to question it. Who knows what would happen now that I\u2019d been made better? Maybe that meant I was supposed to do something with all these colors I was seeing. Become a painter or a writer of some kind. I never did either, but I did pay attention to the little ways people can be assisted when they\u2019re struggling. When I turned eighteen, I started posting little notices all around my town.\nPotential meaning--I don\u2019t know if I can actually do miracles. It seems to me that if someone\u2019s had a miracle bestowed upon them, it might have rubbed off a bit.\nI found out pretty quickly that I have no skill at healing the injured. I can\u2019t make ignorant people worldly or hateful people kind. I laid hands on my cousin Sherman, who could never remember anybody\u2019s birthday, and his bad memory stayed bad.\nWhen I had no luck with people, I tried animal and mineral. The family dog was missing an eye, and no matter how hard I prayed over him, the eye never grew back. Dead plants remained dead. I tried to turn a head of lettuce into a cabbage--a simple enough miracle, I would think. Nothing doing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Crystal,\u201d my father comforted me as I held the leafy green, \u201cI never did like cabbage too much anyhow.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until my sophomore year of college that I discovered I could do miracles after all. My roommate, Rhonda--I think her name was Rhonda?--She had trouble getting that carrot stick sleep. She\u2019d toss and turn all night. Finally, one night, I said to her, \u201cRhonda, I\u2019d like to try and perform a miracle on you, if you\u2019re up for that.\u201d\nRhonda looked at me like I was a talking pentagram, and I guess I don\u2019t blame her. She came from a family of atheists and Communists, and people were always trying to show her Jesus in their cornflakes in the mess hall at breakfast. I let her know I wasn\u2019t trying for a conversion. Just wanted to contribute to the positive energy of the Universe.\nThe poor thing was so exhausted, I think she would have let Ivan the Terrible sing a lullaby to her if it would have helped. Ivan was probably a better singer than me, so I didn\u2019t try anything like that. I just sat across from Rhonda--I think her name was Rhonda. Rhonda or Rhoda like from \n--I sat across from her and I told her I\u2019d be right there, sitting awake, if she felt like sleeping.\nNow, she must have thought that was the dumbest thing she\u2019d ever heard, because what good does somebody sitting across from you do when you\u2019re trying to sleep? If anything, it should make you self-conscious, shouldn\u2019t it? Somebody staring at you? Eyeballing you while you\u2019re trying to give your beleaguered body some respite? But something in my soul told me that was what Rhonda needed, and you know what?\nShe passed out in two minutes flat.\nWell, once word got out that I could put people to sleep, I was loaded with requests. It turns out college students live and breathe off potato chip sleep, and if I could help get them to the higher plane of REM, they\u2019d have more energy for studying--or partying. That\u2019s how I ended up sitting across from someone every night until they went to sleep. Two minutes was all it took--sometimes less. Nearly all of them offered to pay me, but I wouldn\u2019t hear of it. I was so excited to finally have a gift, there was no way I was going to risk losing it by using my ability for selfish reasons.\nNot to mention the fact that as soon as I found my first gift, my second one came along right behind it. You see, once I started helping other people sleep, I noticed I didn\u2019t need any sleep of my own.\nOh sure, I\u2019d try.\nAs soon as my nightly charge was awash in slumber, I\u2019d retire to my own bed--but nothing would happen. I\u2019d just lay there. The wild part was that it didn\u2019t affect me whatsoever. Every morning I\u2019d get out of bed feeling as revived and refreshed as if I\u2019d slept like Van Winkle under his tree. I told my doctor about it, and he explained to me in a very slow-moving voice, that I had to be getting sleep. That there was no way I could exist without it. He said I\u2019d die if that was the case.\u00a0\nThat was nearly forty years ago.\nI haven\u2019t died. I haven\u2019t slept. And I can still get anybody to sleep in two minutes or less--free of charge.\nOnce somebody asked me if I miss sleeping. I couldn\u2019t lie and say I didn\u2019t. I used to have wonderful dreams every night about flying over the great mountain ranges of the world. Soaring through the blue skies--especially once I knew what blue was. Then again, you have to sacrifice if you want to do good in this world. I lose some sleep, and somebody else gains the sleep I lost. Seems like a fair trade to me. And all that extra time comes in handy. For one thing, I always get my taxes done early.\nMost of the time I\u2019m there when somebody wakes up. To see the realization on their faces that they\u2019ve been asleep when they thought they were going to be eating potato chips forever? It moves me every time. The doctor who saves your life may be like a god to some people, but the woman who tells you she\u2019ll be there if you feel like letting yourself go for a few hours so nobody comes along to harm you might just be an angel.\nOh yeah, that\u2019s how I think of it. Maybe the reason people can\u2019t sleep is because we have it conditioned in our bones to never be vulnerable. Never weak. Never at risk of having somebody or something hurt us. So as much as we tell ourselves to give in to rest, another more primal part of us fights back. It might go back to the Stone Age days, I bet. Chances are, nobody got any real sleep until we started sleeping in packs. In communities. One person always stayed up with the fire to make sure nothing bad happened. Even then, I bet some people had a hard time. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Good sleep is a matter of trust. It\u2019s hard to trust these days.\nSome people think of me as a kind of Sleeping Angel, but I don\u2019t see it that way at all. I just think something about me is easy to trust, and this is one of the benefits. You see me sit down across from you, and that part of your brain that\u2019s been keeping you up says--\nThe next thing you know, you\u2019re flying through those blue skies just like I used to do.\nI\u2019ll admit it\u2019s not much of a miracle, but--\nOh, would you look at that.\nAnd I didn\u2019t even have time to sit down.\nWell, some are easier than others, I suppose.\nBetter go call--\nFrank?\nIs it Frank?\nYou know what?\nNever mind.\nI\u2019ll ask you when you wake up."}

He cradled her chin with one hand and gave her a kiss that still curled her toes.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she conceded, looking apprehensively at the towering structure.\u00a0\nWhile they walked down the woodland path to the haunted house, she shared with him the last gooey bites of buttery caramel, luxuriously wrapped around a crisp Granny Smith apple. In turn, he fed her large chunks of funnel cake, topped with whipped cream and a caramel drizzle.\u00a0\nDusk fell swiftly.\u00a0\nShe sensed shadowy figures on the fringes of the fallow field from the corner of her eye; whether they brought her good cheer or meant her harm was indeterminate. She had a fairly good idea what was going to happen in the haunted house, but there was enough uncertainty to slow her step.\u00a0\nHer boyfriend stopped up short and looked directly into her eyes. \"Look. We don\u2019t have to go. We can ride the Ferris wheel or the Tilt-A-Whirl.\u201d\n\u201cI \nto go,\u201d she said, fooling neither of them. \n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be right by you. You trust me?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \n\u201cBut what if someone or something pops out of the wall and I pee myself?\u201d\n\u201cIs that likely?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if I get \nscared and poop my pants?\u201d\n\u201cIs THAT likely? I mean, we can stop at the bathroom if you need to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cUgh! I\u2019m being ridiculous. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d\u00a0\nWarm and reassuring in the late October chill, his strong arm encircled both of her thin shoulders.\u00a0\n\u201cHey. Remember. If you get scared? Keep your eyes on me,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nShe nodded. That would be easy to do. Ever since she first saw him in elementary school, she thought he was the most beautiful boy in the whole world. Little had changed since.\u00a0\nNow settled on the matter, there was just the path forward.\u00a0\nThere was no turning back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83d\udf0b \ud83d\udf0b \ud83d\udf0b\nAs they approached the attraction, he held her hand as they climbed the endless staircase to the top of the old mill, converted each fall into the popular horror show. She could hear screams\u2014immediately followed by loud laughter\u2014from both inside the mill and all around the \u201cHowl-O-Scream\u201d grounds.\nA vampire with bleeding eyeballs motioned them to the entrance. A crowd expectantly waited, only a few sent in at a time.\u00a0\n\u201cDoes anyone have any cold medicine? I\u2019m coffin too much,\u201d the vampire joked.\nHer boyfriend snickered. She stood stone faced.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe some fruit? I just love neck-tarines\u2026\u201d\nThe crowd chuckled good naturedly as it moved forward.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a bad artist,\u201d the vampire continued. \u201cI can only draw\u2014blood.\u201d\nThis time, she joined her boyfriend in giggling at the bad puns.\u00a0\n\ud83d\udf0b \ud83d\udf0b \ud83d\udf0b\nFive minutes later, she had dug her fingernails into her boyfriend\u2019s arm.\u00a0\n\u201cNo! No! NO!\u201d she shrieked, when they walked into the Mad Doctor\u2019s Operating Room. The deranged patient lay supine on the surgical table, hacking off his own leg with a hatchet. Gouts of fake blood spewed everywhere. A ditzy nurse with a knife in her back gleefully mopped the floor.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s chopping his leg! He\u2019s chopping his leg!\u201d his girlfriend repeated over and over, each time more shrill.\u00a0\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s just an animal bone. Not a femur, I promise,\u201d her boyfriend explained. \u201cSee? His real leg is tucked underneath the table.\u201d\nThe next room was worse: the medieval torture chamber. A girl about her age was lashed to a rack, writhing in pain as a masked man ratcheted the wheel. A little farther down, another young girl was displayed, impaled in a solid iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior.\n\u201cBehold, the maiden in the Iron Maiden!\u201d announced her tormentor. He threw a bucket full of clear liquid that had the word \u201cACID\u201d emblazoned on the front.\u00a0\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d she howled, when they entered the Inferno, devils dancing in a demonic disco, all decorated in Day-Glo paint, illuminated by the black lights.\u00a0\nHer boyfriend just put his arm more tightly around her.\u00a0\nAfter a few more terrifying rooms, they finally exited the mill into an empty clearing. After the hay bale maze, all they had to do was to walk to the end of the lane where their friends awaited, no doubt drinking hot chocolate around a bonfire.\nBut the lane was lined with large oak trees, the perfect jump-scare alley.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost through, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, blinking back hot tears.\u00a0\nThey walked arm in arm.\u00a0\nIn a flash, a werewolf loped over to them, long white fake fangs bared.\u00a0\n\u201cGAH!\u201d she screeched, dissolving into a gibbering mess, faced pressed into his shoulder.\u00a0\n\u201cLook, Wolfman. Fuck off, okay?\u201d\n\u201cMwahahaha\u2026\u201d the wolf man laughed menacingly, returning to the woods.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d he said to his girlfriend. \nWhat an inadequate word to call the love of his life. He would take her to prom. \n. \u201cKeep your eyes on me, okay?\u201d\n\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d\nHe looked sternly at her.\u00a0\n\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d she repeated.\n\u201cBut what if\u2014you give me this dance?\u201d he said, fumbling with his iPhone, queuing up their favorite song. The first twangy chords of her parents\u2019 wedding dance soothed her immediately. By the time Anne Murray crooned her country ballad, her boyfriend had taken her into his arms, faux-waltzing her through one horror after another.\u00a0\nA mummy staggered over, muttering ancient curses, but she was lost in her boyfriend\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\nFrankenstein and his bride attempted to stop their progress, but he tucked a lock of hair behind her ear.\u00a0\nWhile Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees stood with dripping knives high overhead, even they paused to see the lovely young couple, enraptured, slow dancing down a lane of mayhem.\u00a0\nBy the end of their dance, all the creatures and monsters and villains had come from the edges, applauding as a couple finished their dance, turning a night of tricks and treats into a veritable Valentine\u2019s Day.\u00a0"}

{"title": "An Unvoiced Biography", "story": "She hurled me into the truck. I thought that it was time for me to assume another duty but the decaying and putrid odour was an eye-opener. I looked around and saw that I was surrounded by rotten vegetables, discarded meat, diapers, plastic and whatnot. Reality struck me like a lightning and my misconception was gone with the wind. I was in a trash truck and was soon going to rot in a dump. \n \nOne look at my stained and disfigured self and anyone would concur that the dump was the right place for me. But I wasn't always like this. I was born more than a decade back when a local artisan took those lovely, fluffy cotton balls in his hands and had spun, spooled, warped and knit them into cloth. \n \nI was then sent to a finishing mill. I was bleached and mercerised. I shone in full glory and was capable of being dyed. A woman probably in her mid-thirties had bought me for a few pennies. She was my mistress. I was elated that I finally had a home to call my own.\n \nMy mistress folded me and placed me inside a cabinet. She had eventually forgotten about me. I lay in the nook of the cabinet, with every fibre in my being feeling stifled. Holding onto the hope that one day, I would be put to use, I spent the days and nights in frightening solitude. There was always light at the end of the tunnel.\n \n\u00a0On an ordinary and uneventful morning, she took me out of the cabinet. I noticed that she was surrounded by needles and threads of different colours. My dream was about to come true. She sat comfortably on a chair on the porch. I fluttered in the cool breeze. I took a deep breath and allowed the beautiful feeling, the feeling of being useful to someone sink in. Suddenly, I felt a prick in my skin. I flinched. She tightened her grasp on me and prevented me from falling. She secured me in an embroidery hoop and gave me another prick. I didn't flinch. I got used to the prick. She carefully designed a garden with flowers and butterflies. \n \nShe ran her hand over me and I revelled in her endearing touch. As I stared at my reflection in an ornate mirror, I almost jumped in joy. I felt that I was enchanting. I was happy and thankful for all the pain for no pain no gain. Isn't it? \n \nShe folded me with great precision and placed me inside her handbag. I was her newfound companion and was on cloud nine. Suddenly, there was a jolt and I had begun to rattle and shake. I imagined that I was on a car ride. I was given a design and now a joy ride. I was on a roll.\n \nBut my happiness didn't last long. My mistress took me out of her handbag and handed me to a man. The happy bubble in which I dwelled was punctured. She signed on a piece of paper and without looking at me even once, she left. I thought that she was gone forever. The man dumped me among a pile of other clothes that he hoarded. \n \nI got used to being unproductive. I hated it but I had no option. On an uneventful morning, he grabbed me and threw me on a table. I flinched and shuddered. My lips moved in silent prayer. Suddenly, he ran scissors across me. Was he going to tear me into bits and pieces? Was I about to be discarded? Where was my mistress? Wasn't it her duty to protect me? A million thoughts ran hither thither in my mind. \n \nHe ran a few stitches across me, here and there and placed me in a polythene bag. My eyes yearned to get a glimpse of my new look but were of no avail. \n \nI'm not confident about this but probably after a day or two, I felt as though I was being lifted. I was removed from the bag and blinded by the bright light, I squinted. I was used to the darkness and the light felt like a foe. \n \nWhat I saw surprised me. A little girl donned me. I was transformed from simple cotton cloth to a beautiful frock. My eyes fell on my mistress. She was looking at the little girl in admiration. Love oozed out of her eyes. That little girl was her daughter. \n \nI was her favourite possession. She had worn me on several important occasions like her friend's birthday party, Thanksgiving Day, and Sports Day. I felt that I was important. I felt worthy. I liked being cared for and attended to. \n \nBut all good things come to an end and so did our companionship. The little girl was not little anymore. She had outgrown me. It was time to bid adieu to the beautiful family. But my mistress, that benevolent soul, never ceased to surprise me. \nScissors were run over me one more time but I wasn't afraid anymore. I had begun to trust her. She spread me on a table. I was transformed into a tablecloth. My form and duties didn't matter to me as long as I was under her canopy of care. \n \nI was soiled all the time. She never put me for a wash in the washing machine. She soaked me in cold water and gently washed me with her hands. She carefully removed all the dirt and grime and I shone like a new cloth. I loved her and was thankful to her. If not for her I would have been a simple piece of cotton cloth. \n \nA few years passed. Her hair greyed and my fibres were worn out. She gave me a new role. The role of a tea coaster. I happily adapted to my new form. As days passed, I had become less functional. I was a liability. A liability that anyone would want to get rid of.\n \nIgnoring my dilapidated state, she used me like a duster. She wiped every piece of furniture, door and window using me. I wasn't excited about my new role. The dust and mite irked my skin. I was bruised all over. Eventually, I was coerced to assume a new role. The role of a mop. She used me to clean the countertop. The oil and spices made me feel nauseated. \n \nShe no longer washed me with her hands. I churned in the washing machine in the company of other clothes. I was not special to her. Not anymore. \n \nAfter getting enough out of me, she finally hurled me into the trash truck. I wish she had given me a little space in her home and her heart. I wish she had not discarded me like a piece of filth. \n \nThe hopper opened and I flew in the air only to land in the dump. I looked around and noticed that many pieces of clothes were lying around. Maybe it always came to this. This is how we have been treated for aeons. \n \nI closed my eyes and waited to disintegrate. Albeit her discarding me was not of good taste, I owed my life to her. I have had my share of good and bad memories. But I wish to cling to the good memories. With that thought, I said sayonara to the world and was transported to another world, ready to take a rebirth."}
{"title": "The Ninth Morning", "story": " \n \nMy morning started with me lying facedown on the floor.\n \nThe hardwood was cool against my cheek. It would have almost felt nice, if it wasn't because my wrist was throbbing in pain from breaking the fall from my bed. It took me a few minutes to gather my bearings.\n \nMy alarm hadn't gone off yet. The light coming through my window was the pale light of the really early morning hours. I pushed myself up with my good hand, ready to climb right back into bed, but stopped when I looked down and saw what I was wearing.\n \nMy cotton pajamas had been replaced by layers and layers of... Silk? No. The fabric felt too soft and airy, though it did have a shine to it that resembled silk well enough. The texture was so pleasant that I could sleep in it as comfortably as I could in my pajamas, but this outfit was no oversized t-shirt.\n \nI scrambled to my feet, drowsiness and pain evaporating away in the face of curiosity. Standing up, I looked down at a long white dress that seemed ripped out of a fairy tale.\n \nThe skirt flared wide, like that of old-timey ballroom gowns. It looked like it should have been heavy, but the fabric was so light that even the numerous layers practically floated around my legs.\n \nThe bodice had the look of a corset, flush against my skin, but it was far from restrictive. There were no wires or laces. The thin fabric clung to my chest and waist as if by magic.\n \nThe bodice and skirt were embellished with flowers -not floral prints or even embroideries. There were dozens of actual daisies, poppies, bluebells, dandelions, iris and even orchids. The flowers' colors were bright and the petals unblemished. I plucked one coral-pink orchid to examine it up close. There were little dew drops on the petals, and a delicate sweet scent rose from the flower.\n \nI looked at my bed next: the sheets were tousled and wrinkled, like they were every morning. I plopped down on the bed in a flurry of skirts and petals. I stared at the blank wall.\nI regretted the fact that I had no mirror. I hadn't had time to buy one yet for the new house.\u00a0I didn't plan on buying anything new until I finished unpacking boxes- and I wasn't even halfway done with that.\n \nI had felt out of place in the house before. There were no decorations, my bed and an old sofa were the all the furniture I had, and most of my belongings were stuffed into unlabeled boxes and the occasional garbage bag. But this was the first time that I felt out place and out of time.\n \nI sat in a daze for so long that the light streaming through the window grew bright and hot. There were birds singing outside, loud enough to be annoying. I turned to look toward the window. It was open.\n \nI finally stood up and walked around the bed, to the opposite wall where the open window offered a clear view of the trees outside.\n \nI remembered closing that window last night. It was a French style window, so its panels swung out wide. I shut it to avoid bugs flying into the room, or worse. Part of the house's charm was that it had several acres of woods out back. As much as I loved that, I did not want to wake up and find that a fox had climbed in through the window.\n \nCould a flowery gown have flown in through the window? Maybe a performer lived nearby and was drying laundry? I supposed I could have put on the dress in my sleep.\n \nI tried to remember what I had been dreaming about before falling off the bed. I could't recall any images, but I did get the vague memory of feeling nervous, or anxious maybe. It was the sensation of my heart beating fast in my chest.\n \nI could have spent all day pondering how I came to be wearing the dress, but I was forced to put those thoughts to rest when my phone's alarm jarred me back to the present.\n \nI took off the dress, leaving piles of flower petals on the floor in the process, folded it up as nicely as I could and shoved it in a mostly empty closet.\n \nI all but forgot about the whole thing for the rest of the day. The weirdness of it all seemed to fade in the mundanity of a day spent in an office, typing emails and making phone calls. That night, however, I made sure to shut the window properly before going to bed.\n \nI woke up in a dress the next morning.\nIt was a different dress, though it was made of the same soft fabric, and covered in flowers as well. This one was an apricot color, and most of the flowers were pink thistle. Before I spent too long examining this dress, I shut my eyes and tried to remember what I had been dreaming about.\n \nAgain, I remembered a sensation more than anything else: a nervous excitement. I grasped at the feeling, trying to return to its source. I got an image \u2013 a glimpse really- of stars, twinkling in the gaps between leaves on twisting branches. Try as I might, that was as far as I got in my memory. I looked toward the window, and found it open yet again.\n \nThe day that followed was as uneventful as the day before, but I did not forget the strangeness of the morning as easily. I couldn\u2019t dismiss the event as easily now that it had happened twice.\n \nOn the third morning, I woke up in a periwinkle dress, covered in blue flowers. I recalled starlight, and a smell like rain on leaves. The window, that I had shut the night before, was open.\nOn the fourth evening, the open window was no longer a surprise. I hadn\u2019t bothered to close it at all. The dress was pink and the flowers purple.\u00a0I had dreamt of moist earth, and a memory of a sound; a flute, I thought, or some other wind instrument.\n \nAnother four nights passed. Three new dresses graced me each morning. The hardwood floors in my room were covered in a rainbow of flower petals and my closet was half full with extravagant gowns. The flowers never seemed to wilt: even the first dress looked as fresh as it had when I first wore it.\n \nI was ready to fall asleep and wake up dressed in flowers by the ninth night, but something changed then. I didn\u2019t fall asleep. I was wide awake when they came through my window.\n \nI heard the sound of rustling leaves first, then tapping on the window glass. I tossed off my blanket and got up, looking down to confirm that I was still wearing pajamas, before going to the window. There were three visitors outside, easily visible in the bright moonlight: a fox, a deer, and a bear. They all looked right at me, eyes bright.\n \nThe bear, who was the largest and fluffiest of the three, was on all fours. Something pale rested on his back, in stark contrast to the dark fur. It was a dress.\n \nThis one was a pale silver-blue; the color mimicked the moon's glow so well that it almost seemed made up of moonlight. The flowers on it were violet, blue, and white.\nThe fox began to pace around the bear's front paws, looking at me expectantly. The deer bobbed its head at me. I felt my heart begin to beat more quickly, but I didn't feel nervous or afraid (despite the very large bear outside my window). I was excited.\n \nI grabbed the sides of the window frame and pulled myself up and through.\u00a0I hopped outside, feet landing lightly on cool grass.\n \nThe spring air was pleasantly cool.\nI stood hesitantly, until the deer gently nudged me toward the bear. The bear lowered his head reverently as I approached and grabbed the dress. I slipped out of my pajamas and into the gown, which fit as perfectly as all the others had.\n \nAs soon as I was dressed, my three visitors turned around and started walking toward the line of trees. I followed them into the forest.\n \nThe skirt reached to my ankles in front and trailed longer in the back. The fabric moved like mist over grass and roots, never getting caught or feeling like it dragged against the ground. Moonbeams pierced the canopy of leaves above us, painting the path silver.\n \nI didn't know what path we were following, but I walked with a sure step. I hadn't had a chance to explore these woods during the day, but the trail felt familiar. The smell of wet bark, the rustling leaves and the soft fabric of the dress caressing my skin, struck me with a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0\u00a0vu so strong it made my eyes water.\n \nThe memories of my dreams from the past eight nights came forth just beneath the surface of recollection: it felt like they were contained in a rising bubble, a mere touch away from bursting and releasing everything.\nThe bear, deer, and fox led me to a clearing among the trees. I passed underneath a pair of bent trees whose branches had entwined in such a way that they formed a wooden threshold. I stepped through it and arrived at a magical feast.\n \nThe moment I crossed the threshold, the bubble burst and my memories came flooding back.\n \nI was in a wide field covered in flowers. I recognized some of the flowers: they had adorned my dresses for the past nine days. The field was brightly lit. The trees on the field were spaced apart, so the moon and stars glowed here without much interruption, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason it was so bright. Spheres made of glass hung on long strings attached to the trees\u2019 branches. Inside each glass, a golden light twinkled: like a hundred miniature suns.\u00a0\n \nThere were two long tables set on either side of the field. A banquet of fruit and cakes decorated the tables among flowers scattered on the golden mantels. There were fine glass goblets set on the table. Though no one stood by them, the goblets were all full with a shimmering liquid that I couldn\u2019t have identified.\n \nThe breathtakingly beautiful display was fit for a royal feast. And yet, all of it paled in comparison to the one other person who stood in the field.\n \nHe stood directly across me, dressed in a coat and tails that appeared to me made of the same, airy fabric as my dress. No flowers decorated his suit, but the silvery blue fabric shimmered -practically glowed- as if it was covered in minuscule crystals that caught the light and reflected it back with every movement. His hair was long and silver, his face smooth and the features sharp. He was smiling, the way a little boy would smile if he had gotten away with something. Mischievous.\n \nMy heart thrummed like a hummingbird.\n \nI had been coming to this feast night after night. I had met that creature every night. I had danced with him, my feet bare and my dresses flowing around me as we twirled over the wildflowers. He had held my hand in his, had held me by the waist and whispered in my ear.\n \nHe stepped toward me. He stopped when he was close enough that I could see his eyes: like opals, iridescent hues twinkling. Just as he had every night before now, he held a hand toward me. I obliged by taking it and letting him place a feather-light kiss on fingers. His smile widened. And, just as he had every night, he asked me to dance. Again, I said yes.\n \nI never knew where it came from, but music filled the air. He led me in a dance I had never learned, but somehow I never missed a step. He spun me and pulled me close, my dress floating gracefully in a dance almost its own.\n \nHours could have gone by- I wasn\u2019t counting. Not tonight, or any of the nights before it. I could have happily kept going, dancing until dawn, but we always stopped before morning came.\n \nHe let go of my waist, but held onto my hand, bringing it up to his lips for one more kiss. He looked at me, and I knew what he was going to ask. He would ask the same thing he asked every night.\n \n\u201cWill you stay?\u201d\n \nEvery night, I had answered the same thing. Every night, I had crossed the threshold that led back to my house. I would wake up with nothing but a dress, and a faded dream. Every night, I had told him \u2018no\u2019.\n \nTonight, I leaned forward and gave him a kiss. On the ninth night, I chose to stay.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Always and Never", "story": "Sensitive: sexualized language, and cursing. \n \nThree years ago today, it was a Mother\u2019s Day Sunday.\u00a0There is an anniversary picture on my cell phone of my infant daughter sitting in my ex- husband's lap. The memory holds a story of spouses, out to dinner, with two beautiful children. \u00a0\nIn the picture, her Father looks blankly beyond the camera, with no affect in his face; the musicians must have been in that direction because my infant daughter is also gazing in the same direction (and there is a rational voice inside me that knows certainly they are not BOTH avoiding my gaze). The memory holds that he had a double jack-and-coke; the picture shows it was half gone before we were seated. The memory holds the same absence of enthusiasm for the rest of the meal.\u00a0\n\u00a0I can recall making an intention to verbalize gratitude and enthusiasm to engage my family and incite joy in the children, \u201cOh my goodness look at all these cakes! Sweetheart would you like a cake with Mommy?\u201d\u00a0\nTwo months later, it was a Tuesday morning, before leaving for work, on a bright orange morning of summer, when I threatened him with an exasperated\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll wake up alone one day if you\u2019re not careful!\u201d\u00a0\nWhen he replied \u201cGood!\u201d I decided aloud \u201cToday\u2019s the day!\u201d\u00a0\nSince then, I have thought a lot about being alone. At the time it had felt like such a worthy curse to consequence him with, after all the things I had\u00a0felt I had coped with doing alone in our love together. \u00a0\nAfter I left him, I often felt panicked that \u201cNOW... no one would know the real me!\u201d A faulty assumption that a. he ever \u201cknew\" me in the way I had romanticized and b. that somehow the internal world I romanticized my whole life could somehow be understood by any willing party living outside of it. \u00a0\nI despise the exclusionary elitism of the phrase\u00a0\u201cyou have to be good at being alone before you can be with someone else.\u201d I have been good at being alone my whole life; as a child, as a married partner, and now as a free mother in the world. I tended\u00a0to siblings and smoked cigarettes alone as a teenager, then listened to music, did my nails, and painted in oils\u00a0and wrote in black leather-bound journals, alone.\u00a0\nI occupied myself with house cleaning, making dinner, tending to babies, working out with punk music and pink legging sets, going to bed reading books and drinking tea as a loving wife, alone. \u00a0\nAs a free Mother I shopped, went to movies, tended to plants, ate\u00a0ramen, and watched Sci- fi alone very well. I cry, steam, sing, dance, scream and cum alone in the light of day or the dark; my solitary resume is complete. \u00a0\nDespite these skill sets my heart does desire sharing these things, in the morning and at night, with someone curious enough to learn my romantic internal world. Even all the spiritual teachers I would listen to would deny the necessity to train oneself around the truth of their hearts, as vines around a scaffold. \u00a0\nThen a shift started several months ago, where I could embrace answering my own desires intentionally. It was then I realized I had been doing this for several years, simply out of necessity rather than the choice. Making the intentional choice to attend to my alone-ness was, yes, novel, I will admit that here. In doing so I discovered many voices to be heard inside me; yes, the famed \u201clittle me\u201d (the one living in all of us -I dare you an evening alone with a nostalgic food and movie pairing), a hero animal (mine a large oil-breathing and red eyed dragon, now often sleeping), a wise minded (handsome, tall, dark werewolf of the screen) figure of Jesus to guide me, and finally my pensive perished Great \u2013Aunt watching me peacefully from her seat inside the wooden box of silver flatware she gave me after my son was born. \u00a0\nWeeks went by and I kept this audience company as I navigated my new life, feeling supported by my own personal universe and kept by closest friends. \nI felt, always holding this group of voices inside me, their drinks spilling as I breathed and fretted about outside their waiting room in my chest. Several weeks went by peacefully in this fashion, petting the dragon\u2019s head and watching the child color pictures and practice meditation, her tiny hands folding obedient at our heart. Jesus\u2019 hand resting on my heart and my Great \u2013Aunt watching down on me (which is strange to visualize from inside me) with tranquil approval. \u00a0\nThose several weeks passed and finally, I was not anxious about my daily life of living \u201calone\u201d as I laughed in the out-and-about with my family of voices inside me. I was engaged and attentive to my daily and fluctuating needs, so much so that soon, all the voices dissipated. Naturally it is objective to report that also, I think I performed much better overall in my few external relationships as well (she says thoughtfully scratching her chin and looking up above her shoulder). \u00a0\nAt first, when I noticed the quiet, I had assumed that since I had grown attentive to my needs, the childish personification of my moral compass, my immature defense mechanisms, all of that had dissipated away into a more mature and whole conceptualization of my being. I was so pleased with my newfound maturity. \u00a0\nSuddenly, on a Sunday afternoon, after picking up the groceries and just before piling up the laundry, I became awash with cold, white dread. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis voice has not allowed me rest, no matter what reframe or wise Aunty I compel to soothe my fear. I have quietly pondered this truth for 24 hours. I realized that when I was married, or now that I am a free mother, when I am surrounded by people or here in the dark, I am alone with my experience. No one will understand my experience of magical animals and strong Jesus except through my voice and the magic I give them. All the people I see as \u201cconnected\u201d on coffee dates or in dancing poses are still just two people sharing their alone; they have actively tailored their form for the purpose of fa\u00e7ade that there is an elevated state beyond the truth I have frightfully realized. \u00a0\nMy maturity and I waited for the understanding of this sad knowledge to grow into something else. Neither handsome Jesus nor little me came forward with any answers, and the red \u2013eyed dragon remained asleep. I continued behaving the way I always do, except, with the knowledge that I would not be fighting against the truth today. I knew, I would always be alone, but secondly, and more importantly, there was liberation at the bottom of this terrifying well, dammit and I would stay present in this fated disillusionment until I came out the other side. \u00a0\nI did my day\u2019s work under this cloudy consciousness and sought out no one. \u00a0\nI heard a line while I was folding laundry (if you are folding and putting away all your laundry in the same day there is something  wrong with even you, my friend; leave this reading knowing that even you have still room to elevate to a freedom in which your unicorn of empty hampers is a myth... liberate yourself from the toil of laundry!) that stated something to the effect of suggesting that, if I am trying to fill the never \u2013 ending hole, I am probably missing something in the that moment of vital importance to that hole. \u00a0\nI put the tee shirt down and look up at the reflection of myself across my bedroom; I hear my daughter listening to cartoons in the living room. \u00a0\nI go\u00a0out to join her on the couch; she looks over at me and rests her head into my chest crawling under my free arm, the same fluid movement she has done for the past 3 years whenever we are together in front of a television. We sit this way for twenty-four minutes; I pat her belly and squeeze the soles of her feet gently. \u00a0\nI quietly tell her \u201cIt\u2019s time to brush teeth for bed, baby.\u201d \u00a0\nShe responds with a squeal and a cry \u201cCome here\u201d I whisper, empathic sadness in my upturned mouth for her desperate tears. I hold and rock her as I tell her \u201cIt\u2019s alright- we will watch it again tomorrow.\u201d \u00a0\nI rock her in the fashion I did when she was newborn, on my lap now, her heart against mine, and I hum the same song \u201ctwinkle twinkle little star\u201d. My memory holds so much time that first year, alone with her, us together, in the middle of the night, humming that song from a muscle memory in exhaustion rocking in our recliner chair. \u00a0\nI tell her tonight \u201cI used to sing you this song when you were a baby.\u201d \u00a0\nI do not tell her, that I chose that song, because when I tried to sing to her \u201cYou are my sunshine,\u201d I would cry, every time, until choking on my very breath, at the flippant lyrics suggesting I could ever lose her now that I had her in my arms. \u00a0\nI tell her, \u201cDo you remember that I live in your heart?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes Mommy.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo you remember that you live in my heart?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes Mommy.\u201d A rehearsed magical thought I first taught to her older brother, eight years earlier, still also a part of his foundations of cognitions about our relationship. She lowers her gaze and rests her tearful cheek against my tee shirt, her runny nose rubbed dry in a long swipe on the black cotton.\u00a0\nI do not tell her tonight that it was our solitary moments in wee witching hours in that leather recliner that grew the red- eyed dragon from\u00a0my rib sinews and my boiling flesh, that would eventually carry us to our new life, where she and I could cry, scream, and sing all alone in the night, the strong hand of Jesus and all the universe to support us, Amen. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n "}
{"title": "Daddy's Chair", "story": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Rana, and she lived on a farm. Her family was made of a dad, a mom, six brothers, eleven cows (Bessie died last fall), two dogs, and three cats.\u00a0\nThis day started off quite ordinary. Her brothers were milking the cows.\nRana took her little bucket and walked carefully to the first milking stall. Annabelle, the biggest cow, looked at her with big, solemn eyes. Randy, her brother who was leaning against the cow\u2019s side with his hands working the teats, looked at her with sleepy eyes. \u201cGo ask one of the other boys today.\u201d\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t give me enough. My kitties are thirsty all day then.\u201d\nRandy sighed. \u201cHold your bucket closer.\u201d\nShe obeyed, and he filled it almost to the top. \u201cMy kitties will say thank you, Randy.\u201d He mumbled something. She held the bucket with both hands and walked to the corner of the barn. Taffy, Shaggy, and Ruffles came to her right away, and she petted them while they drank their milk. When they were done, the boys were done milking, and everyone went inside for breakfast.\u00a0\nMama asked the same question every morning. \u201cWhat are you guys doing today?\u201d\nRandy said he and Rey were going to work on the treehouse. Ricardo was going to draw pictures of all the birds he could find. Rowan, Rudy, and Ryan were going to go fishing. Rana wasn\u2019t sure.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to come grocery shopping with me?\u201d\nRana shook her head. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go fishing too.\u201d\nRudy protested. \u201cYou always splash around and scare the fish away.\u201d\n\u201cNo need for loud voices at the breakfast table.\u201d Daddy didn\u2019t like arguments. \u201cI noticed a weak spot in the fence this morning, so the cows have to stay inside today. I\u2019m going to walk the fence and see how much lumber I need to get. We\u2019ll need all hands on deck tomorrow for repairs.\u201d\nLater that morning, Rana found herself walking down a deer path through the woods. She could hear the creek to her left. She followed the path until the trees opened up to a meadow. She could see the creek now, bubbling happily into the pond. Ripples made the reflected sky look magical, and she smiled.\u00a0\nThere were a lot of sweet williams blooming at the tree line. She picked a handful and brought them to the pond\u2019s edge. She picked off the individual flowers, put them gently into the water, and watched them dance on the ripples.\u00a0\nFarther away, the pond was as smooth as glass. She could see the boys across there, sitting on the bank with their lines in the water. She watched Rowan get up and hand his pole to Ryan.\u00a0\nRowan made his way to a big maple tree that grew close to the pond. He jumped for the lowest branch and caught it on his first try. Rana watched as he pulled himself up and wiggled along a big branch that hung over the water. He motioned for Ryan to hand him back his pole.\u00a0\nRyan held on to the tree trunk and leaned out with the pole. Rowan bent from his branch and reached. He grabbed the pole, lost his balance, and pulled Ryan into the pond with him.\u00a0\nThey made a wonderful splash. Their big ripples came all the way across the pond and fought with the little creek ripples. Rana giggled as they climbed out, dripping wet and shivering, and Rudy groaned about \u201cfor sure not catching any fish now\u201d.\u00a0\nAll four made their way back to the house. Rudy cleaned up the poles while Rana ran inside for dry clothes. She came back and threw them into the barn, where Rowan and Ryan were changing.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do we do with our wet stuff?\u201d Rowan wrung out his tshirt. \u201cMama wouldn\u2019t want it in the house.\u201d\nRyan shook out his hair like a dog. \u201cWe can hang them up in Bessie's stall.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so humid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if we turned on that little heater? Just until our clothes are dry.\u201d\u00a0\nThis course of action was adopted, and the extension cord was run to Bessie\u2019s stall for the little heater. The boys left to see how the tree house was coming along, and Rana climbed up to the loft to find her cats.\u00a0\nShe dug a little nest in the hay and waited. Soon Taffy and Shaggy were purring happily as she scratched around their ears. Ruffles curled up beside her and fell asleep.\nA weird sound came from down below; like popcorn, almost. Rana frowned and stood up, sending the two cats away. She walked to the ladder. \u201cBoys? Are you down there?\u201d She caught a whiff of air that smelled like winter: woodsmoke.\u00a0\nThe cats followed Rana as she clambered down the ladder into a haze of smoke. Annabelle and Clara were shifting nervously on either side of the empty stall. Rana could see tongues of fire licking up the straw around the heater. She unplugged the extension cord, then ran for her little bucket and filled it up at the water trough. She sloshed it over the heater, but the fire was spreading fast through the hay. She dropped the bucket.\nRana ran for the big door and threw her weight against it. She pushed it all the way open, then grabbed the morning bell and rang it twice, the same way Randy always did when they were finished milking. The cows stirred and started backing from their stalls, but the fire had reached the wall and was racing up it.\u00a0\nBarking caught her attention as Guardian and Lassie dashed past her into the barn. They pushed the cows, nipping at their legs. Rana watched in relief as the cows exited the barn one by one until Lizbeth was out and the barn was empty. The whole ceiling was on fire now.\nRana sent the dogs, and thereby the cows, to the other end of the pasture. Then Mama got home from grocery shopping, and she got scolded for standing so close to the barn. It was all burning now.\nThe boys came running, and Daddy came up from the field. Everyone wanted to know what happened, but Rana was busy coughing. The barn turned into a pile of ashes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEvening came. Daddy and the boys set up a makeshift fence to keep the cows from getting too close to the scene of the fire. They did the milking into extra pails from the garage. Rana got a container from Mama to give milk to her cats, but only Taffy and Shaggy came running.\u00a0\nRana suddenly remembered Ruffles, curled up in the hayloft. She burst into tears and ran into the kitchen. Mama let her cry until the boys were washed up, then dried her tears and led her to the table.\u00a0They prayed. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI want you to eat a little bit, at least. Do you want to tell us what happened first?\u201d\nShe told the whole story, but broke down when she got to the end with poor Ruffles. Daddy looked at her very seriously before getting up out of his chair.\u00a0\n\u201cRana, I want you to switch spots with me.\u201d\nShe halted mid-sniff. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThis spot is for the protector of the family. You did a lot of protecting today. Your quick thinking saved all the cows, and two of the cats.\u201d\n\u201cBut Ruffles\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRana,\u201d he pulled back her chair and gave her a hug. \u201cYou did everything you could. I\u2019m proud of you. Go sit in my chair.\u201d\nShe felt very small in Daddy\u2019s chair. The boys all looked like they wished they had been at the fire. Rana wished they would have been there, too. Maybe they could\u2019ve saved Ruffles.\u00a0\nBut Daddy was proud of her. She wiped her nose and sat a little straighter. Maybe she could eat some supper after all.\u00a0"}

I\u2019m guessing about two months along.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have a baby!\u201d Destiny blurted out. It would be later in the day before she realized the doctor implied her being pregnant was bad news.\n\u201cYes, I'm afraid so. I\u2019ve arranged for you to meet with a family counselor. You do have options.\u201d\n\u201cOptions?\u201d Destiny raised one eyebrow. \u201cWhat the heck do you mean by that?\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want the\u2026\u201d the doctor paused mid-sentence.\n\u201cI want the \u2018the\u2019,\u201d Destiny interrupted. \u201cI want my baby with all my heart.\u201d\nThe rest of the appointment was a blur. Destiny had so much adrenaline running through her veins that she couldn\u2019t concentrate on what the doctor was saying. When he had finally given her the literature and prescriptions for prenatal vitamins, Destiny sprinted out of the office to the closest bus stop. She had some shopping to do.\nWalking up and down the aisles of the baby boutique, Destiny quickly realized how expensive children were, a fact crystalized when she overheard a salesclerk completing another customer's transaction.\n\u201cThat will be $798.15.\u201d\nThe customer, a well dressed young woman with perfect hair and nails, pulled out a Visa from her purse and inserted it into the credit card chip reader. The clerk and the customer chit-chatted about strollers and cribs and bassinets, neither phased by the large total on the sales slip. Destiny paused and opened up her wallet which had just a SNAP card, a stick of gum, and four one-dollar bills. \nDejected, Destiny turned to leave the store. On the way out, however, she spotted\u00a0the clearance rack.\u00a0\nThe mishmosh of garments was not inspiring to say the least. There were odd colored outfits and mismatched shoes, almost nothing worthy of a second look. Desperate yet determined Destiny discovered a lone light blue onesie with the word \u201cLOVE\u201d lettered in red on the front. It had been hidden behind a hooded parka with a ripped sleeve. \nDestiny thought to herself. \nThe little outfit had been originally priced at $20.00, but had been reduced twice to $5.00. Destiny, commited to purchasing the adorable find, opened the change compartment in her wallet and poured out a handful of mostly bronze coins. As she started to count, she found a single quarter, four dimes, and three nickels. Without even counting the pennies, she grabbed the onesie and marched up to the counter.\u00a0\n\u201c$5.25, please,\u201d the cashier announced, as she folded the outfit and placed it into a bag.\n\u201cI only have $4.92,\u201d Destiny answered, as she quickly counted out the pennies. \u201cI just found out today that I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, ma\u2019am,\u201d the cashier said with a wink. \u201cI forgot the friends and family discount, so that will be $4.92 exactly.\u201d\nIn her life, Destiny had never been so grateful. For thirty-three cents, the cashier had bought Destiny dignity and the new mother-to-be would never forget the kindness.\u00a0\n*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\n\u201cI have good news and bad news.\u201d\n\u201cListen very carefully, Eli. I\u2019m pregnant, perturbed, and I have to pee. \n Are you sure you want to mess with me right now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby doll, you know me. I joke. It\u2019s my way.\u201d\n\u201cFine. What\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom just called\u2014she\u2019s on her way over.\u201d\n\u201cDestiny is coming? How is that bad news? I love your mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou know how I feel. She\u2019s always wearing that awful uniform. Can\u2019t she take five minutes to change before she barges in?\u201d\n\u201c\n? Are you ashamed of your mother?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no.\u201d\n\u201cThat woman is a saint. She worked her ass off to put food on your table.\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2014but the uniform\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou should love that uniform. She paid for your college\u2014as a waitress.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut nothing\u2014your mom is on her way over. That\u2019s the good news. Now go make some herbal tea.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Eli to make the tea or for his mother to make it to the house.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Eli shouted when the doorbell broke the silence.\n\u201cBe nice,\u201d Melody yelled back, causing Eli to laugh out loud just as he opened the door.\n\u201cHello, Elijah,\u201d Destiny said, wrapping her arms around her son\u2019s neck. In his whole life, Eli couldn\u2019t remember a single time that his mother failed to hug him the first time she saw him. He loved the attention as a boy, but, like most teenagers, he resisted it as he got older. On this day, however, he welcomed the display of affection. His wife had reminded him just how lucky he was, and he wanted his mom to know as well.\n\u201cHi mom,\u201d he said as he stepped to the side, motioning her in. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see you.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Destiny responded with a wink. \u201cShould I have changed before I came over?\u201d\n\u201cNo, mom,\u201d Eli answered, feeling a bit guilty, giving his mother an unexpected second hug.\u00a0\n\u201cHow is Melody? You aren\u2019t annoying her, are you?\u201d\n\u201cA little.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. You be nice to that girl. She's been good for you and to you.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs in bed, Mom, but I know she\u2019d love to see you.\u201d\n\u201cIn a minute. First, I brought something I wanted you to have.\u201d Eli looked down and saw a perfectly wrapped gift in his mother\u2019s hands.\n\u201cMom, you shouldn\u2019t have. I told you we have all we need.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have this, and I\u2019ve been waiting so long to give it to you.\u201d Destiny said, handing Eli the package.\n\u201cShould I open it now?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d she answered with a smile.\nEli found the seam and carefully tore off the blue bunny-covered wrapping paper. Inside was a plain white box, taped on all four sides. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small pen knife which he promptly used to cut the tape. Finally able to open the box, he pulled off the top, allowing him to see a small faded light blue onesie with the word \u201cLOVE\u201d printed in red on the front.\n\u201cMom, I can\u2019t take this. It\u2019s important to you.\u201d\nThe story of the onesie, the clerk, and the thirty-three cents was cherished family history and the outfit was Destiny\u2019s most prized possession.\n\u201cWhen I was young,\u201d Destiny explained, \u201cthis was my way of showing you I loved you. I bought it myself, and I gave it to you. It\u2019s time to give it to you again so you will always remember the only thing that is truly necessary to give your child is love. Please give it to your son. Will you do that for me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Eli answered, \u201cLet\u2019s go show Melody.\u201d\n*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\t*\n\u201cI have good news, dad.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, kiddo?\u201d Eli asked, looking down at his son.\n\u201cGrandma isn\u2019t really dead. Wanna know how I know?\u201d\n\u201cI do, Ben,\u201d Eli responded, genuinely interested in what his five-year-old son was about to say.\n\u201cWell, my teacher, Mrs. Conroy, she told me that as long as we keep loving people, they never die. That\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it dad?\n\u201cIt sure is, champ. Mrs. Conroy knows what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\u201cThen I want to do something for grandma. Is that alright?\u201d\n\u201cWell that depends, kiddo. What do you want to do?\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d The\u00a0little boy answered, charging out of the room, only to return a moment later.\n\u201cI want to give her this,\u201d Ben said, holding up a little light blue outfit for Eli to see. \u201cL. O. V. E. That spells love. Grandma taught me the letters. Can I give it to her so she knows we love her then she won't really be dead?\u201d\n\u201cBen, where did you get that?\u201d\n\u201cI found it in my closet. Grandma told me all about it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, you can give it to her,\u201d Eli said, holding back tears. \u201cI think she\u2019d like that very much.\u201d\nThere wasn\u2019t much talk on the way to the funeral home or during the service. Ben made sure to keep very quiet, waiting for the opportunity to give his grandmother her gift. When most of the crowd had left, Eli found Ben.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\u201cReady.\u201d\n\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nTaking his hand, Eli walked with Ben up to the casket where Destiny lay.\n\u201cShe looks like she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Ben observed, looking up at his father then back down at Destiny. \u201cI think she is smiling,\u201d\n\u201cI think so, too.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, Grandma,\u201d Ben said as he laid the small light blue onesie near Destiny\u2019s heart. He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a quarter, a dime, and three pennies, laying the coins under his grandmother\u2019s hand. He whispered something Eli could not hear. Then the two turned around and walked out of the chapel.\n\u201cWhat did you tell Grandma?\u201d Eli asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d Ben answered, with a serious look on his round little face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I promise I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d\n\u201cI told Grandma I was giving her thirty-three cents.\u201d\n\u201cThirty-three cents?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Dad. Just in case they don\u2019t have the friends and family discount in heaven.\u201d"}
{"title": "In My Dreams", "story": "They called my name from the black microphones in their hot hands. The crowd erupted in applause and cheers. The stage manager gave me a light nudge on my back, and I took one shaky, deep breath. I emerged from the shadowed wings into the spotlight, which created an intimate focus of attention on me, dressed in a green, sequined button up top, leather pants, and dress shoes too tight for my big toe to breathe.\nI could hear the whispered sounds of the crowd as they stared at me, in awe and admiration, and in judgment. My muscles relaxed, and I accepted the loneliness of the circular stage. My head tilted to the right and whipped to the left, and my entire body spun 360 degrees.\n\u201cHit it,\u201d I shout into my wireless microphone, and the pre-recorded drum beats sound. The energy of the audience shifts when mine exudes for their enjoyment. Seven years of; disappointment, rejection, working exhausting shifts at fast food restaurants, performing gigs at weddings for cash that would only allow me to eat fast food, and writing, producing, and marketing myself for labels. Finally, my dreams are coming true in front of those who believed in my talent; my manager Tessa and best friend Kalif, and those who were waiting on my downfall; my family.\nMy hit pop single, which is number 5 in \n and sold 200,000 copies in one week, is now being performed for the first time, live, on stage, in front of millions of viewers watching the \n, and my adoring fans who came to support me.\nI ready my throat for the first verse of my song, \n.\n\u201cWake up, wake yourself up baby. The sound is getting louder, and you can\u2019t be at peace. Boom boom. Boom boom. You try to sleep in your misery, but it eats you alive. Your ears are consumed with the deep vibrations, you can\u2019t survive. Boom boom. Boom boom. Boom\u2026\u201d\nMy eyes fly open to see my fraying floral wallpaper in the darkness of my tiny bedroom.\nI slip my feet into the warm slippers Kalif gifted me for my 35\n birthday last year. I navigate through my low lit apartment, grabbing the grey jumper that hangs on my dining chair, and leave apartment #100 to berate a woman 15 years my senior.\u00a0\nDenise isn\u2019t a bad person; she\u2019s one of my best tenants. Rent is always given to me on time; she often brings me Ukrainian food packaged in plastic containers when I don\u2019t have the energy to cook rice and chicken after teaching several lessons at my uncle\u2019s music store, or dealing with building issues and inquires. She also supports my endeavors and passions for music, as she is the lead drummer for \n, a classic rock indie band.\nI have told her numerous times, she is only permitted to play her drums between 12pm and 5:30pm. If she wants to continue playing, she has to find another space out of apartment #101. But, for the past few days, I have been waking up to the same nuisance every night, \n.\nI don\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t want me to dream in peace. But I seem to be the only person bothered by the noise because I haven\u2019t received any complaints from other tenants. But tonight, I am going to end this nonsense. I wonder if any landlords have ever filed for noise complaints against their own tenants before?\nI lightly tap her emerald green door, carefully listening for her footsteps on the other side. Her hair is wrapped in a silk scarf patterned with giant dead rodents, her bands infamous logo.\n\u201cIkenna.\u201d\nShe\u2019s the only tenant that is on a first name basis with me.\n\u201cThis is your first warning, Denise. I\u2019ve been hearing you play those drums of yours two nights in a row already. At first, I figured you just got carried away and would remember the rules and obey them, but if that were the case, I wouldn\u2019t be standing here in front of you.\u201d\nShe yawns loudly and wipes saliva from her upper lip. Her eyes are narrow, trying to adjust to the light from the hallway behind me. \u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping since 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you weren\u2019t just playing the drums two minutes ago?\u201d\nHer face holds confusion and she shakes her head.\n\u201cMan, I think you\u2019ve been working too hard. You need some rest.\u201d\nShe waves for me to leave and slowly closes the door.\n\u201cThere it goes again!\u201d my right hand applies enough pressure to push the heavy door back. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\nI peer over her shoulder into her kitchen, then to her cozy living room, and finally the wooden bedroom door that is wide open, revealing her messy bed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quiet as a mouse. I\u2019m sure everyone is asleep right now, which is what I think we should both do,\u201d she says agitatedly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Denise, I don\u2019t want to pry around your space at such an inappropriate time like this, but I have been hearing this \n sound, and it\u2019s driving me crazy. Can you please allow me to search your apartment?\u201d\nShe rolls eyes, \u201cIkenna\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t wait, Denise.\u201d\nI reflect my desperation into her tired eyes.\n\u201cBe quick. And just advising you, you\u2019re not going to find anything, because I\u2019m not playing any drums or music, and there\u2019s no one in here.\u201d\nI ignore her as the \n continue to taunt me. I creep around the space like a lucrative robber, opening cupboards, peaking outside the open window that reveals a lonely alleyway. Only coming across cans of beans and soup arranged erratically, a bathroom with no faulty pipes, and the slight weeping sounds of the nightly wind. I\u2019ve checked this poor woman\u2019s entire apartment, and still couldn't figure out the source of the noise.\nI head back towards the front door, \u201cMy apologizes, Denise. Maybe I\u2019m going insane or something. I\u2019ll probably investigate the other apartments in the morning. Again, I\u2019m so sorry. Have a good night.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, night.\u201d\nMy feet stop in its tracks near a flimsy coat closet in the front entrance of her apartment.\nIt\u2019s louder than before. Clearer even. I look to Denise and she stares back with no reaction, just a sleepy trance. I point to her closet and gesture that I\u2019m going to open it. Her loud exhale can\u2019t even be heard over the booming sounds that repeat in an aggressive manner. My shaky hands reach for the brass knobs, slowly turning them to the left. The dark, dusty state of the closet is a dead end. The sound is present, but all I see are coats and spiky sneakers or 8 inch heels. My head leans closer to into the closet, understanding of the ominous feeling flooding my senses.\nWhat is this noise and when will it end?\n\u201cYou need to go back to your room, Ikenna,\u201d a voice says.\n\u201cYou sound funny, Denise.\u201d\nI turn around to see Denise is no longer standing behind me with her arms crossed. She is sitting on her cream couch, and a man dressed in blue scrubs stands in the spot she previously stood in. His arms coax me into his grasp, and I lean into his body.\n\u201cI need to find the noise!\u201d I shout with rage.\nKalif shushes me, \u201cI know, I know, but we need to get you back to your room now. You shouldn\u2019t have been able to leave your room this easily, you know.\u201d\nHis brown beard scratches my cheek, and we walk in unison out of Denise\u2019s apartment. She sits still on the couch, staring at nothing, never acknowledging us.\nBefore I can digest the pity I feel for her, I am back in my bedroom. This time, there is a woman dressed in identical scrubs, strapping black Velcro bands around the bed poles and my wrists. The woman smiles at me and reaches over my head towards the antique shelf screwed on my wall. Her veiny hand comes back into my view, holding a transparent pill organizer. She opens a flap and shakes her head, her locks shaking by her forehead and pierced ears.\n\u201cI see you haven\u2019t taken your meds yet. You can\u2019t be skipping on your pills, Ikenna. I know you don\u2019t like taking them, but it\u2019s only for a little while. Until you get better. It\u2019s going to help you get the \n out of your life and get you home to your family soon,\u201d Tessa explains calmly.\nShe hands me a blood orange pill and a half empty water bottle. I ingest. Tessa is pleased and switches my bedside lamp off.\nMy upper and lower limbs are strapped to the bed, I attempt to dream peacefully."}
{"title": "The Fishermen Song", "story": "Have you ever spoken to the rain?\u00a0\nShe did. She\u2019d lift her head up, gaze at the clouds, and listen closely.\u00a0\n\u201cListen.\u201d She\u2019d say. \u201cListen to the rain.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nI'd look up at the greying clouds but hear nothing. Because the rain never spoke to me. It only spoke to her. I wish I knew what it said. What secrets they shared. I always imagined it spoke in whispers. Something so beautiful. I remember the day we sat by the lake. The trees waltzed with the wind around us. Autumn leaves broke away and swayed in twirls towards the infinite. The smell of the earth was so pungent. So pure. I stole a glance at her, sitting beside me. Eyes reaching for the sky. Her soft, silky hair flew behind her. Drips of water fell on her nose, and it made her smile. As though the rain had just shared an inside joke.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d I said at the time, still not getting anything.\u00a0\n\u201cIt said its happy we\u2019re both here. Everybody else is leaving.\u201d\u00a0\nI looked around, and realized it was true. The minute the clouds gathered, and the rain picked up; people started to leave. Families packed their lunches and headed for their cars, dragging their kids behind. An older couple snapped their umbrella open and wobbled to the parking lot, wrapped in a hug. The park stood almost empty, save for us and the bikes that drove us here.\u00a0\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like getting wet.\u201d I said.\u00a0\nShe giggled, allowing the beads of water to dribble from her chin. \u201cI know. It\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0\nThe thunder didn\u2019t spook her. I watched it flash in the distance, roaring its dominance. But she never flinched. Not even a little. She said that the thunder, the clouds, and the rain are one. They complemented one another. Just like she and I. Just like everything around us. The earth, the sky, the wind, the animals, the trees. Humans. We all speak to one another. Connected by a celestial bridge.\n\u201cBut what happens when things die?\u201d I had asked. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that break the connection? The bridge, I mean.\u201d\u00a0\nShe shrugged. \u201cThere is no death. You only move on to the next life. And then the next, and the next. It never ends. Life goes on.\u201d\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t understand it at the time, and honestly, I didn\u2019t bother to inquire any further. I was satisfied with what she said. Whether it was true or not, I didn\u2019t care. I liked the sound of it. Life goes on. It sure seemed like it did.\u00a0\nI remember she liked to sing. She\u2019d make up some new songs and sing them to me on our way to school. She said the clouds helped her come up with the right words. She even proved it once. We were walking to school on a spring day when she stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and gazed up. I watched her fix her eyes on the sky\u2019s languid movement. Silent. Everything around us was so silent. I feared that time had stopped. That we\u2019d be stuck here forever, and I\u2019d never hear her sing again. Then her lips moved, and she smiled.\n\u201cLook,\u201d She pointed a finger. \u201cThey look like sailing ships. The blue sky is the ocean.\u201d\nI looked up, shielding my eyes from the glaring sun. \u201cShips? I don\u2019t know, maybe.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re telling a story. About the fishermen at Black Bear Lake.\u201d Her light hair swooshed over her shoulders. She stayed still, like one of those porcelain figures my mom liked to buy from a local antique shop.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhat kind of story?\u201d I asked.\u00a0\nShe paused, then said. \u201cThe normal kind. Fishermen came to the lake yesterday morning, opened their nets, and threw them into the waters. When the sun left, so did they.\u201d\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t know how to feel about that. It sounded a little. \u201cBoring.\u201d I said. \u201cWhy would the clouds tell you that?\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t offended by it. She actually giggled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be interesting to be beautiful. The fishermen were happy to be there. They loved the big puffy cloud because it gave them cool shade when it became too hot. We\u2019re all connected, remember?\u201d\u00a0\nShe later sang the song about the fishermen. The one that the clouds inspired her to sing. I can\u2019t remember much of the words today, but I remember it went something like this:\u00a0\n. There were tides, seagulls, and ropes. I pictured the strings of sunlight hitting the ocean. The smell of salt and sweat. It stayed with me for days.\u00a0\nUntil one day, months from then, I heard that song again. I remember that day so vividly. Like it was yesterday. I heard that song on the radio. It was sung by a school choir. It wasn\u2019t exactly the same, but it was pretty close.\u00a0\n. I couldn\u2019t believe it. How did they know the words? I rode my bike and raced to her house. I wanted to tell her about the radio song right away.\u00a0\nShe beamed, joyful. \u201cI told you! It\u2019s the bridge. We\u2019re all connected. They probably saw the ships in the clouds, or at least, one of them did.\u201d\nWhether I believed her or not, I didn't know. But these are stories that I will hold so dear. Even though still today, I haven\u2019t been able to hear the whispers of the rain. Every now and then, I'd lift my head up to the clouds and watch the rain go down. The sound it makes as it hits the window. Drizzling on the tall metal pipe that almost touches the sidewalk. The splashing of water behind speeding tires. The blurred orange hue of streetlights, just before the sun tucks behind the horizon. Closing a lid on a darkened sky. I try to listen. Hopeful it\u2019ll speak to me like it did to her. But it never did. It only spoke to her.\u00a0"}
{"title": "The Plant That Never Gave Up", "story": " \n\tOut of curiosity Cecilia walked into the garden shop and trolled around. The air inside was remarkably cooler than the stifling outdoor summer heat and she felt refreshed as she walked among the ferns and the palms touching their surfaces and just enjoying the textures. Reaching a shelf of very angular straight leafed plants she hesitated and stared at them. She had never really seen these before and she found the clustered sharp tipped plants very intriguing. The leaves were a sharp green with a yellow outline and white mottling. Reaching out, she touched the large thin leaf, curious about its fleshy thickness and amazed by how rigid they were.\u00a0\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a Snake plant.\u201d a soft voice from behind her said.\n\tShe quickly withdrew her hand and turned to face the voice. It was from a gentle, rounded man with a kind face who stood there smiling with his hands clasped tightly behind his back.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhy is it called that?\u201d She asked.\u00a0\n\t\u201cYou can see, at the tip of the leaf blade, it narrows to a point like a snake\u2019s tongue.\u201d\n\t\u201cOh yes.\u201d she said. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\t\u201cThis is a wonderful specimen and the best part of it is, you can\u2019t kill it. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\nhe added.\u00a0\n\tShe nodded slightly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve never had a plant before.\u201d She thought for a second, twisting the ends of her red hair before deciding. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d and with a delicate motion, the shopkeeper took the plant she liked, wrapped it in tall brown paper to protect the sides and off she went.\u00a0\n\tShe was pleased with herself as she took the plant home and set it on the sill at the west facing window. She had been depressed lately and had hoped this could brighten up her mood. She stood back and looked at it in the afternoon sun. It seemed to glow in a sunbeam as she crossed her arms and smiled. As she stood there, her yellow Labrador trotted over and sat next to her, trying to appreciate whatever she was appreciating. \u201cWhat do you think Ollie?\u201d Cecilia asked. Ollie\u2019s only response was a nudge on her leg with his nose.\u00a0\n\tAs if on cue, the doorbell to the apartment rang and Cecilia opened the door for Amanda, her best friend. Stepping into the apartment with a nod to Cecilia and carrying a canvas shopping bag full of groceries, Amanda walked through the apartment straight towards the kitchen, as the dog trailed behind her with a steady jog and a wagging tail. She placed the bag on the counter and it promptly collapsed, allowing a variety of fruits and vegetables to tumble out. Quickly, she snatched a tomato that was rolling off the edge and towards Ollie's curious jaws.\n\t\u201cI am going to make you dinner tonight!!\u201d Amanda exclaimed with a flourishing wave of her hands. \u201cSince we are now in our late thirties and we can no longer handle our booze.\u201d\n\t\u201cUh, actually it was the hangovers that I am having trouble with.\u201d Cecilia corrected.\n\t\u201cWhatever!\u201d Amanda retorted. \u201cI will instead intoxicate you with a Nicoise salad and a small glass of Chianti!\u201d Amanda grinned at her presentation and was pleased with Cecilia\u2019s soft smile. Amanda held out her arms and approached her best friend. They hugged very tightly and the small silence was soothing. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Amanda asked sincerely once they parted.\n\tCecilia nodded slightly. \u201cI\u2019m ok. The funeral was tough, but a lot of my dad\u2019s friends were there, and my brother was there with his wife and three kids.\u201d\n\t\u201cHave they been trained yet?\u201d Amanda asked.\n\t\u201cThey were nice, however, I think it was a small dose of Bendryl that may have played a part. With kids under three you can get away with that.\u201d Amanda resumed her station behind the center counter in the middle of the kitchen.\n\t\u201cIn my parent\u2019s day,\u201d Amanda began as she took a knife out of the block. \u201cit was the whiskey rag. They said it was for teething, but I now appreciate its duplicity.\u201d\n\tThe kitchen wall was open to a large dining room with windows which faced the west, where the new plant had been placed. Amanda glanced into the dining room and spied the plant. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Did you buy a Sansevieria?\u201d she asked, pointing the knife loosely towards the new addition.\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a Snake plant.\u201d Cecilia corrected her.\n\t\u201cSame thing.\u201d Amanda replied. \u201cWhat is with this! A new chapter in your book of life?\u201d\n\t\u201cNo, well maybe\u201d Cecilia replied sheepishly, \u201cJust saw it and it cheered me up.\u201d She was reflective for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year, with my mom dying last summer and my dad dying last week. You know, the decisions, the saying goodbye, the telling everyone.\u201d\n\tAmanda now pointed her knife at Cecilia. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the grief. You need to handle that.\u201d\n\t\u201cWell,\u201d Cecilia reflected. \u201cMaybe this is a first step towards that.\u201d\u00a0\n\tAmanda opened the bottle of Chianti while Cecilia took two large wine glasses out of the cupboard. Pouring generous amounts of equal part each glass, Amanda raised hers and then Cecilia raised hers in response.\t\n\t\u201cBest friends forever!\u201d Amanda declared.\n\t\u00a0\u201cSalut!\u201d Cecilia replied and they began constructing the dinner. With the bottle of wine disappearing quickly, they decided that perhaps the promise of restraint was premature and Cecilia called down to her friend Mark who lived two floors below to bring in some reinforcements. Happily obliging, he arrived with two Beaujolais nouveau and a wonderful smile. Helping them with the settings, he then took the two bottles and proceeded to open one. As he cut the aluminum, he noticed the plant on the sill. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the Mother in Law Tongue?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a Sansevieria.\u201d Cecilia corrected him. \u201cSame thing,\u201d was his response as he uncorked the bottle and the level of the gathering elevated.\u00a0\n\tOver the next few hours more people were invited and with that the spirits switched from red to brown. It was about this time of the night when Mark was describing his stepmother while riding a broom between his legs like a pony, that the end of the broom snagged the side of the pot and the new addition went flying away from the window, crashing on the floor. Luckily the pot was a heavy plastic and remained intact and they were able to gather up the soil while Cecilia steadily centered the plant in the middle of the pot. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Cecilia kept saying. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill it.\u201d to reassure everyone.\n\tA few hours later, the plant\u2019s resolve was once again tested as a friend of Steve\u2019s from down the block tried to balance the plant on his head. Swearing that he had a lineage to circus performers, he aptly showed he didn't carry the gene by allowing the pot to slide off his forehead and crash onto the floor, its fine, dry soil scattering over the area rug in a thin sheet. The clean ultra white roots showed helplessly as Cecilia once again gathered the plant and the pot and tried to reconnect them. In order to get the soil out of the rug, Amanda used a small dustbuster vacuum which cleaned it up, but also collected an abundance of dog hair. Emptying the container into the pot, the new plant was now leaning to one side comfortably nestled in a collection of dirty, long yellow fur, like a green obelisk growing out of Harpo Marx\u2019s wig. The plastic of the pot, which was so resilient before, fared poorly. This time a long crack showed up on one side, which Mark - \u2018the engineer\u2019 as he reminded everyone- repaired with some gray duct tape he had found under the sink. Cecilia once again placed it back on the sill, saying aloud as if issuing a command. \u201cYou cannot be killed.\u201d\n\tAs the evening faded away, the crowd began to thin and an intoxicated Cecilia made her way to her bedroom, where she leaned forward, hoping gravity would do the honorable thing and place her correctly on her pillow.\u00a0\n \n\tShe was roused to consciousness by a hot wind blowing on her face in quick bursts. Opening one eye, she turned her head and saw Ollie at the edge of the bed, his mouth lined with soily lipstick. The plant lay helplessly at his feet.\u00a0\n\t\u2018Oh Ollie.\u201d she said softly, the dog now wagging its tail at the sound of its name, stood up and jumped on the edge of the bed, licking her face with his loamy tongue.\u00a0\n\tShe rose up in defense, only to feel a sudden onrush of blood into her head as the hangover commenced. Pushing the dog off, she reached over and picked up the plant. Many of the roots were broken and crushed by the dog's teeth, so she delicately lifted it from the floor and carried it back into the kitchen. On the way there she saw the pot on the floor. She picked that up with her other hand and carried everything over to the kitchen sink. She was able to collect the hair/soil mixture up again, although she added more duct tape to the pot to repair another crack, and just ignored the huge chip in the pot's edge. Once she had everything back together again, she noticed it was low on soil, so to compensate, she pushed the plant down forcefully to get it deeper into the pot. After two healthy pushes, she pushed hard one more time to make sure the plant would stay upright. In doing so, she felt a huge pop, and almost all of the tall leaves snapped off in her hand. Holding the victims in her palm, she stared at the creation in the sink. With one long leaf straight up in the center, there were now two much smaller leaves remaining on either side. She gazed at the new assembly, which she took to be a statement on her care so far. Equating the center leaf as a middle finger, she nodded. \u201cOk, I deserve that.\u201d she said out loud.\u00a0\n\tHaving now completed the reassembly, she placed it back on the window sill, made some coffee and sat in the dining room. She sipped it slowly as her senses began to return. After a few minutes, she heard a buzz on her phone and checked the text message.\n\t\u2018Coming over in half an hour. Found some stuff you may want. You up?\u2019 Normally after a morning like this one, she wouldn\u2019t have replied, but this was Brian her brother and she knew he was cleaning out some closets in her parents house. \u2018Up.\u2019 she texted back, then gathered up the strength to get into the shower and get dressed.\n\tAs planned, Brian showed up and although she was still groggy, she was ready for him when he approached the door. As promised, he had with him a box of odds and ends. As he walked through the apartment, he noticed the\u00a0 plant.\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s with the \n?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\n\t\u201cIt's a Sansevieria.\u201d she replied knowingly.\u00a0\n\t\u201cSame thing.\u201d he said as he furrowed his brow upon examining it closer.\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t kill it.\u201d she answered defensely.\n\tHis face scrunched together with concern. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to try. When did you get it?\u201d he asked.\n\t\u201cYesterday afternoon.\u201d she answered. \u201cWant some coffee?\u201d she asked to change the topic.\n\t\u201cSure.\u201d Brian slowly poked at the fur. \u201cDid the plant come with some sort of insulation?\u201d\n\tCecilia ignored him and just continued talking. \u201cWhat stuff did you bring over?\u201d she asked as she brought him a full cup. She set it on the table and peered into the box.\n\tRegaining his focus, Brian turned to the box. \u201cOh, uh.. just some books, a few pictures of relatives you may know, because I surely don\u2019t know them and this.\u201d he pulled out a small, white vase with hand painted enamel lettering. \u201cI found this on an upper shelf in the closet.\u201d It said Love you champ! in a mixture of uneven blue and red letters.\u00a0\n\tCecilia stared at the bowl adoringly. She set down her cup and gently took the bowl with her two hands. Sitting down she ran her fingers over the lettering softly. \u201cHe made this for me. It was Father\u2019s Day and I think I was like eight. Mom was there too, but she took you with her to get something or other. So he and I slipped into this pottery shop. You know one of those where you buy the pot and then paint whatever you want on it.\u201d\n\tShe stopped touching the bowl and looked nostalgically out of the window to the street outside. \u201cI made him a bowl that said Best Dad Ever.! and he made this one for me.\u201d\u00a0\n\tThey were quiet as she processed the memory, then tears slowly began to trail down her cheeks. \u201cI miss him so much.\u201d she said with a sob. Brian picked up the emotion and reached out to her. She rose and fell into his arms as he held her tightly while she gently cried on his shoulder. After a few moments, she regained her composure and was able to stop crying.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it just catches me.\u201d\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he smiled. \u201cIt gets to me too.\u201d They hugged for a moment longer, then Brian pulled away and placed his hands on the box. \u201cSo um.. go ahead and go through this stuff. Let me know what you want or don\u2019t want.\u201d Then he rubbed the moisture out of his eyes.\n\tHe stayed for a while longer, to make sure she was okay. He even took Ollie out for a walk. Then after about an hour, he rose and began to take out his car keys. He looked back at his sister. \u201cAre you going to be alright sis?\u201d\u00a0\n\tShe nodded her head and offered a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d\u00a0\n\tHe studied her eyes and, satisfied that she was sincere, he gave her one more deep hug and left the apartment.\u00a0\n\tShe sat there throughout the morning, still in a haze, but optimistic about the weekend as she touched base with friends and did some work. She was mostly in remembrance of the man who made the pot. Suddenly, the obvious struck. She left the apartment for a few hours and when she returned she had purchased a book on indoor plants, fresh potting soil, a grow light and a small packet of liquid fertilizer. Within a half an hour she had transplanted the plant into the new pot, replaced the soil, set up the light and fertilized the plant.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not giving up on you.\u201d she remarked as she continued checking it every day and following the care instructions. On the fourth day, she was rewarded. Getting ready to leave for work, she checked the plant before she left only to see a small, thin lime green leaf slowly snaking its way up out of the soil. Two days later, another appeared and a day later a third.\u00a0\n\tAfter two weeks, Amanda stopped by on a Sat. afternoon to see if Cecilia wanted to go out for lunch. Since Amanda hadn\u2019t seen the plant since its initiation ceremony, she was surprised at the change.\n\t\u201cHello.\u201d Amanda cooed to the plant. \u201cThere is less of you, and yet more.\u201d\n\t\u201cYeah,\u201d Cecelia said. \u201cI snapped off a few leaves by accident, but I took care of it and now look at this. It\u2019s coming up fast.\u201d\n\t\u201cTold you it can\u2019t be killed.\u201d Amanda said. \u201cCute pot. Where did you get it?\u201d\n\tCecilia smiled as she slipped her hands into the front pockets of her jeans. \u201cIt was from my dad.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "The Photograph That Had Her Past Engraved On It", "story": "Squabbling seagulls flew overhead. Rachel sat on the sand with waves crashing against her ankles. The waves of the sea produced an opera, that was soothing. The sea seemed like a beautiful woman dressed in a cerulean blue gown. At a distance, a little girl and her mother were playing in the water. The yacht rocked like a cradle and it felt as though the sea wanted to lul Rachel to sleep.\nShe was physically miles away from the hullabaloo but her mind still lingered in the hospital. Pictures of the IV cannula, ice-cold stainless steel cot, the crisp white bedsheet and a frail figure cascaded before her. The screeching sound made by the wheelchair echoed in her ears. A cool breeze caressed her cheeks and her eyes fell on a velvet box that lay by her side.\nShe squeezed her eyebrows and her right hand fluttered on her neck. With her left hand, she picked up the box and opened it. A family portrait stared at her. Tears welled in her eyes as her fingers took a tour of the photograph.\nSix months back, she had found an old film roll in an antique box that belonged to her father. Intrigued by the film and its contents, she grabbed it and stealthily slipped it into her bag. That evening, she walked into a photo studio and gave the film for processing. She was asked to receive the photographs the next day but destiny had other plans.\nHer father was diagnosed with cancer. The tumour ate away his cells and tissues at a rapid pace. The dreaded C jammed his tastebuds. Rachel moved in with her father. She was engulfed by the whirlpool of work and the 24*7 care his health demanded. The thoughts about the film roll had slipped her mind. Eventually, her father wasn't able to swallow the food and he lost a great deal of body weight.\nA week back, he complained of breathlessness and was rushed to the hospital. IV cannulas were inserted into his frail body. Blood works and scans were done. The doctors had diagnosed multiple organ failure and placed him on life support.\nThe previous evening, he had summoned Rachel into the room and spoke, \"I have a confession to make. But remember, I love you. I have always loved you.\" Tears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks. He slowly lifted his weary hand and pointed to a velvet box on the bedside table.\n\"That's for you,\" he said. Rachel walked to the table and opened the box. She found a family portrait. The child in the portrait seemed familiar to her. Did she know her? Or was it her?\u00a0The couple in the photograph looked unfamiliar. She looked at her father questioningly.\nHe tapped on the bed asking her to sit by his side. He removed the oxygen mask and said, \"I saw you slipping the film roll into your bag. So I got it developed for you. The girl in that photograph is you. You were not born to us. You were my colleague John's daughter. He had lost his job and wasn't able to fend for you and his wife. On the contrary, I and your mom had everything in the world yet we weren't happy. We yearned for a child. Your mother had three miscarriages and had slipped into the abyss of apathy. In an attempt to restore the sunshine in our lives I decided that we must adopt a baby. When I had expressed my desire to adopt, John suggested that I adopt you. Though I was initially reluctant, his pathetic state of affairs convinced me to go with it.\u00a0I offered him money and he had promised to bury our secret. You weren't happy with us for the initial six months. We showered you with love and undivided attention . You eventually got used to us. I and your mom were on cloud nine when you referred to us as mom and dad. Our joy knew no bounds. I hate to confess this to you but I won't live long and you deserve to have a family to call your own.\" He gasped for breath and gripped the bedsheet.\nRachel sat staring at him without uttering a word. He had begun to sweat profusely. \"I'm so sorry.\" His voice was low as a whisper. His face seemed to be creased with lines of regret.\nShe enveloped his hand in hers. His hand was cold as the iron rods lining the window. His face turned purple. He had finally breathed his last. She bent forwards, kissed him on his forehead and closed his eyes. Cancer took him away from her and the truth took away her joy. But nothing would ever be able to take away their beautiful and pure bond. Nothing could ever obliterate the memories of the time they had spent together. She tried to console herself but the truth pricked her soul questioning her very existence.\nThe next morning, as she stood watching the casket being buried into the ground, she decided to meet her biological parents. She managed to acquire the address from an old diary that had accumulated dust on it.\nAfter an hour of steering through the traffic, she reached the Eden house. She opened the gate and entered and saw that two young girls were playing on the porch. A sexagenarian man entered the porch. She assumed that he was her biological father John. A woman joined the family and they ate breakfast. She walked to them and introduced herself. The moment John heard her name the smile on his face vanished. The woman who was supposedly Rachel's biological mother whose name she didn't bother to find wasn't happy either.\n\"She is my colleague's daughter,\" John spoke to the young girls who looked at Rachel questioningly.\nAfter a few minutes, the girls excused themselves. \"I'm your daughter,\" spoke Rachel swallowing the lump in her throat.\n\"You are not our daughter. You never were. You were a mistake. We had given you to Tim. You got a good life and we got some money. A few years later, we were blessed with two beautiful daughters. We are a happy family and wish to remain one. We don't want you back in this house,\" spoke John.\nThe woman didn't utter a word and looked at Rachel as though she concurred with John's opinion. Rachel walked away with the tears choking her.\nShe didn't want to live with her biological parents. Tim had given her the best of everything. He was her father and would always be. All she wanted was to spend one day with her biological parents. Hug them, talk to them, eat with them but they had forgotten her. Just like the waves that omit the names written on the sand money had omitted her from their lives.\nThe smell of the sea tantalized her nostrils breaking her reverie. She got up and walked to the sea. She bent and dropped the velvet box in the water. The waves carried the box that was engraved with her past.\u00a0She gave her past a sea burial. Tim was her father. He loved her and that's all that mattered.\nShe walked away ready to face the new dawn that brought with it hope, positivity and an opportunity to live life to the fullest."}

Her socks were short, her capri pants had risen over her knees.\u00a0Wyatt noticed the spot she rubbed sported a very prominent lump.\u00a0\n \nHe said, \u201cField hockey?\u201d\n\u201cYup, you\u2019re not the only one who gets bullied.\u00a0I fucking HATE gym class.\u201d\n\u201cMe too.\u00a0Wyatt\u2019s in my gym class.\u201d\n\u201cThat fucking sucks.\u201d\n \nThe bringing-buzzing of the bell rang out.\nWyatt said, \u201cAnd speaking of gym class\u2026\u201d\n \nThey got up and walked across the field.\u00a0Starling veered off towards the corridor to the left.\u00a0She waggled her fingers goodbye and said, \u201cGood luck.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0He took one final glace at the sky.\u00a0It was still blue in places, but heavy grey clouds were darkly taking over.\n \n \nGym class was okay that day, they played badminton because it was supposed to rain.\u00a0Badminton was cool cuz was not a team sport.\u00a0After the class, Wyatt was the first to head to the changing room after the hour was up- he liked to change quickly and be out of Lee-Roy\u2019s radar field as fast as possible.\n \nWyatt jumped into the shower farthest from the lockers.\u00a0He froze as a shadow paused at the curtain.\u00a0He let his breath out as the shadow departed.\u00a0He showered and rinsed as if he were in a race.\u00a0With luck, Lee-Roy would still be showering when he was long gone.\u00a0He peeked out the stall.\u00a0No nemesis.\u00a0He reached to the peg where his towel was.\n \nNot there.\u00a0\n \nHe looked at the blue tiled floor.\u00a0No towel.\u00a0\n.\u2019\u00a0Not only was there no towel, but his jeans were also gone.\u00a0He used his gym shirt to towel off, but it was moist with sweat, he had no choice but to put his sweaty gym shorts back on.\u00a0They suctioned onto his damp thighs like limpets on tidal rocks.\u00a0He buttoned his shirt, groaning at the way it clung to his chest and back.\nWyatt caught something dark from the corner of his eye as he passed the bank of urinals.\u00a0In one of them, all balled up and soaking wet, were his Levis.\u00a0\n,\u2019 he thought.\nThe hill-billy guffawing behind him reddened his face uncontrollably. The grating laughter was followed by, \u201cCheck that out!\u00a0You can see everything!\u00a0Hey lil dude, that lil worm so small not even yer girlfriend, the black bird, could find it!\u201d\n \nHe didn\u2019t pause at the mirror, but finger combed his hair into place as he headed for the door to the hallway.\u00a0Half the students pointed and laughed as he walked swiftly through the hallway.\u00a0The other half whispered to their friends as they stared.\u00a0Only a couple of kids looked away, pity painted on their faces.\nHe didn\u2019t stop at the door to his history class, he kept going straight, into the nearly empty cafeteria, and out the side door to the bike racks.\n \n \nAs he pedaled as fast as he could, it began to rain.\n \n \nHis mother wasn\u2019t home yet, she worked late Thursdays, and on those nights, he made dinner for them.\u00a0She probably wouldn\u2019t notice the absence of the Levis but if she did, he\u2019d tell her they were too short, so he\u2019d put them in the Goodwill box, which, by the way, he\u2019d taken into town the day before.\n \nThe deluge of rain worsened into a fantastic storm.\u00a0Wyatt\u2019s invisible friend would be pleased.\u00a0He particularly loved thunder and lightning and the violence of hurricane winds.\u00a0His gleeful enthusiasm had infected Wyatt as well, he went outside into the pitch-black yard and put his face into the torrents.\u00a0He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good one, eh, Archie?\u201d\n \nA voice drifted down from above, \u201cIndeed it is, little friend\u2026\u201d \n\u201cArchie\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u00a0Wyatt Summerland the Third.\u201d The voice was deep but light and melodic, like Barry White speaking in sotto voce.\n\u201cHa!\u00a0What a laugh.\u201d\u00a0Wyatt Summerland the Second had left when he was two, leaving him nothing but a fancy name.\u00a0Wyatt Summerland the First had died of a heart attack five years previously.\u00a0He was technically Wyatt Summerland the Only.\n \nWhite lights painted the fence for a second, dimmed by the downpour.\n \n\u201cShe\u2019s home.\u00a0Gotta go,\u201d Wyatt said to the shadow man.\n\u201cCiao buddy.\u201d\n \n \n \n \nThe next morning was drizzly and dark, with intermittent showers. Wyatt spent too long searching his drawers, his closet, the hall closet, for his hooded waterproof jacket.\u00a0When at last he found it, he realized he was going to be late for school.\u00a0\nAt the school, he stopped at his locker, noting how empty the halls were.\u00a0\n\u2019\u00a0He grabbed his binder and algebra book and slammed the door shut.\u00a0He raced down the hall to his homeroom, slipping and sliding a couple of times like a cartoon character.\n \nThe second bell razzled shrilly and echoingly behind him as he leapt into the classroom.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d he exclaimed as he ran to his seat in the second row.\nHill-billy guffaws from the back row.\n \nThe teacher glared over his half spectacles which always seemed to hang on the end of his thin, pointed nose like magic.\u00a0\u201cYes, I see that.\u00a0I also see that you\u2019re dripping all over my floor.\u201d\n \nWyatt didn\u2019t think it wise to point out the floor wasn\u2019t actually \n but belonged to whomever owned the school.\u00a0Maybe it was the county\u2019s floor.\u00a0\nThere was a row of eight coat hooks at the back of the room.\u00a0He hung his dripping jacket on the end, next to a green striped sweater that had been there since his first day.\u00a0Kids claimed it was haunted, that it had belonged to Freddy Kruger.\u00a0He hustled back to his desk and Mr. Altera continued announcing next week\u2019s events in his nasally, monotone drawl.\nHomeroom was fifteen minutes long.\u00a0Today it seemed an hour.\nSure enough, when the bell rang for the first class of the day, Mr. Altera asked Wyatt to, \u201cHold up a sec.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was late Mr. Altera; it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\u201cApology accepted.\u00a0And seeing as this was your first time, I\u2019ll let it go.\u00a0Manage your schedule better.\u00a0You\u2019ll need to in the real world.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d He scooped up his books and took off for his algebra class.\n \n \nAs he sat in his seat near the front, he realized he\u2019d forgotten his jacket. \n \n \n \nAs he walked into his homeroom, he saw immediately that his jacket was gone.\u00a0The room was empty.\u00a0Mr. Altera was absent.\u00a0He ran to the coat hooks, nothing on the floor.\u00a0He peeked under the ugly sweater with a pencil, careful not to touch it\u2026 just in case.\u00a0Nope.\u00a0\n \n***\n \nBack to Friday\u2026\n\u201cFucking Wuss-boy!\u00a0What the hell?!\u201d\u00a0He\u2019d nearly dropped the photos.\u00a0He felt\u2026afraid.\u00a0Of Wyatt.\u00a0Ridiculous.\u00a0He feared no one\u2026except\u2026\n\u00a0His vision went red as he pictured a meaty fist darkening with knuckle shadows as it came towards his eye.\u00a0He felt the sharp pain of his nose cartilage separating from bone and the thudding pain in his eye socket as it crinkled inwards toward his eyeball. He felt the pressure of the eyeball push inwards.\n\u2026His father.\u00a0He was okay most of the time.\u00a0No, that\u2019s a lie.\u00a0He drank every night.\u00a0He morphed into a monster every night that he could not always avoid.\n \nLee-Roy looked at the photos in his hand and studied each one.\u00a0He had sat down on the crumpled sheets of his bed without realizing he\u2019d even moved, let alone found his way to his room.\u00a0He shoved dirty clothes from the floor to uncover the toolbox. It locked.\u00a0It was empty of tools and was stocked instead with cans of Coors he\u2019d swiped after his father had passed out.\u00a0He even had a travel mug half full of swiped Jack Daniels.\u00a0It was the Jack his trembling fingers grabbed.\nAs he sipped, he studied the photos.\nOne showed his father and him on their front porch.\u00a0He\u2019d been wearing a tee-shirt; under the yellowy porchlight he saw the deep shadows under the fingers that were squeezing his biceps.\u00a0The next was taken that same night, after Lee-Roy had been thrown to the ground.\u00a0His father\u2019s fist was raised high- high for greater momentum and greater impact.\u00a0The third photo was a view through the living room window.\u00a0Father\u2019s left hand held Lee-Roy by the throat\u2026 the right was raised- high.\nThe fourth picture was the Halloween one.\u00a0Lee-Roy smiled.\u00a0The scary decoration revealed glowing eyes and sharp white teeth in an ear-to-ear grin, the gnarled outline of a tree behind it lit up by lightning added to the illusion of scariness.\u00a0\n \nLater, in bed, Lee-Roy listened to the muted voices of David Letterman and his guest.\u00a0By now, Pops would be passed out, and he was safe.\u00a0As his breathing deepened, the last thoughts poked at the logic in his brain.\u00a0\n?\u2019\n \n***\n \nMonday came at last.\u00a0\nLee-Roy watched The Wuss eating his lunch on the far side of the field.\u00a0The black chick (his father called them niggers, but Lee-Roy didn\u2019t understand racism.\u00a0He secretly thought Starling was kinda sexy) was sitting next to him eating her pudding.\nPhil and Dave came up.\u00a0Phil said, \u201cWhatchoo got planned today for the little geek?\u201d\nLee-Roy didn\u2019t look away from the field.\u00a0He said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d\n \n \n \nLee-Roy followed Wyatt to his house.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t hard, the kid lived on a street lined with plenty of big oaks to hide behind.\u00a0He saw the kid enter a small but neat house.\u00a0He watched across the street as lights came on in the living room and deeper into the place.\u00a0Kitchen.\u00a0An older model Chevy Malibu pulled into the driveway and a petite brunette in a waitress uniform- old-fashioned, like ones he\u2019d seen on 'Alice'-got out and went inside.\nIt was getting dark, and Lee-Roy felt bolder under the cover of night.\u00a0He crept around to the back yard, unlatched the fence gate, and hid behind a maple in the yard.\n \nHe saw the kid and his mom chat for a bit then she left the kitchen.\nThe kid stirred a pot on the stove, turned a knob, then headed out the kitchen door.\n \nBefore coming out, Wyatt turned off the porchlight.\u00a0He came into the blackened yard and said, \u201cArchie?\u201d\nLee-Roy jumped out from behind the maple and said, \u201cWe need to talk!\u201d He grabbed the smaller kid\u2019s arm and pulled him behind the tree.\u00a0\nIn pitch darkness, Wyatt said, \u201cYou found the photos, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nLee-Roy grabbed the other arm and shook the kid.\u00a0Then he let go.\u00a0Red memories of his father let go as well.\u00a0He said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nWyatt said, \u201cI took them to help you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\u201cYes! I\u2019ve been studying you.\u00a0I was -\n- writing a paper on, well, \n.\u00a0Figuring out why and what makes you be like you.\u00a0It\u2019s obviously because of your upbringing.\u00a0Your father\u2026and absent mother.\u201d\nLee-Roy gawped at Wyatt.\u00a0He gestured for Wyatt to go on, too stunned for words.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to college to study psychiatry.\u00a0I\u2019m getting a scholarship.\u00a0I got so involved with my study of your case that I may have stepped out of line.\u00a0I took those pictures thinking I\u2019d have proof of the abuse, take them to authorities\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u00a0I got to thinking that you\u2019d be sent to foster care and that may make you even worse.\u00a0As a person.\u00a0And your dad too.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you care about me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid.\u00a0You can change.\u00a0And I\u2019m studying it\u2026\n.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Lee-Roy fell against the tree as if the life-force had flown from his body.\n\u201cI can help you.\u00a0In a totally unconventional way.\u201d\n \nLee-Roy felt as if he\u2019d been squashed under a boulder like the coyote in the roadrunner cartoons, but he also felt the boulder lifting.\u00a0It was\u2026 \n.\u00a0He said, \u201cThat other picture\u2026it was weird.\u201d\n\u201cMy invisible friend.\u00a0After my dad left, I started talking to him.\u00a0He was just a black tree at first, this one.\u201d\u00a0He pointed to the old maple.\u00a0One night the tree spoke back.\u201d\n\u201cThat thing in the picture wasn\u2019t a decoration.\u00a0It was real.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u00a0Archie.\u00a0I call him my invisible friend because he only comes to me in shadows\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s really tall.\u00a0And thin.\u00a0Like a tree with a face and glowing eyes and teeth\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd horns like a Texas bull.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t like his picture taken cuz he needs to be invisible to humans.\u00a0He fakes being a tree really well.\u00a0I convinced him he\u2019d pass for a Halloween decoration.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re just scaring me\u2026to get even or something.\u201d\n \nA voice from the dark came down like Barry White whispering, \u201cYou want my help or not kid?\u201d\nLee-Roy looked up but saw nothing.\u00a0The moon was only \u00be full, but bright enough.\u00a0\nFrom behind the tree came Archie.\u00a0As he unfolded his thin, fifteen-foot body, he turned, revealing an ear-to-ear grin that glistened in the moonlight.\u00a0His body was indeed like a gnarled, tall black tree.\u00a0His eyes glowed.\n \n***\n \nAfter the visit to Lee-Roy\u2019s dad, Lee-Roy never again worried about being beaten.\u00a0His pop was going to AA meetings every night and Lee-Roy made sure they shared a healthy meal.\u00a0\n \nWyatt wrote his paper, got his scholarship, and went on to Yale.\nLee-Roy stayed in Ferndale, devoting his career towards troubled youths and coaching Ferndale\u2019s high school in a fair and entirely new way.\u00a0Him and Wyatt stayed in touch and became the closest of friends.\nArchie moved on to be another lonely kid\u2019s best invisible friend."}

The cat Mouse has nothing to do with\u00a0the name it bears. If anything, we should ( have to) \u00a0wonder what \u00a0to expect from someone\u00a0who calls her cat MOUSE\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c Yes, I agree, that one, Sofia is a bit deranged. Oh, but in my opinion, if she is so crazy, it is because of that guy with whom she lives \u201c Anita said\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c But listen!\u00a0Would\u00a0it be because of her co-living if\u00a0Sofia is touched? I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s right. \u00a0Hee,\u00a0rather it is she,\u00a0Sofia , who is beaten up on her own. He, instead, her partner is even a good painter\u201d Anita\u2019s mother said. \u00a0\u00a0\u201c But yes, a very good painter! In fact he calls himself Botticelli\u2026.What a presumption! \u201c Anita snapped . \u00a0\u201cBut, let\u2019s forget Botticelli and Sofia too. Don\u2019t you want to know what Mouse did?\u201d\u00a0she asked.\n\u201c Of course I want to know. On, tell me \u201c\u00a0\u00a0\u201c Then, listen. When, a little ago, coming back home, I passed in front of Marianna \u2018s house, in the courtyard in front of her house,\u00a0there was a pigeon\u00a0standing on the sidelines, which moved with hesitant, little steps and was limping.\u00a0( which limped too).. It didn\u2019t really looked healthy, that pigeon.\u00a0Its feathers were ruffled and almost dirty.\u00a0It looked old and battered. This pigeon\u00a0not only kept away\u00a0from the chickens, the ducks, and other animals , there in the courtyard, but it seemed to be afraid of them.\u201d Anita started telling, as she jumped sitting on the table, getting a stern look from her mother.\u00a0\u201c I\u2019m listening, but I expected\u00a0you would tell me about Mouse, not\u00a0about a pigeon\u201d Sara, Anita\u2019s mother , said, almost impatient.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c Wait, it is just about Mouse that I\u2019m going to tell you \u201c Anita said, jumping off the table.\u00a0\u201c Then, I stopped there, in front of the courtyard just because I was intrigued by this pigeon which,in my opinion, was even not able to fly, when I saw Mouse arrive. The cat, moving in thick and fast steps, went very close to the pigeon.\u00a0Now I expected that, for a young cat like Mouse, a pigeon so shabby, even lame, even not able to fly, it would be an easy prey. So that, as I saw \u00a0Mouse approaching the pigeon, I expected to see the poor pigeon in the cat\u2019s clutches.\u00a0But instead\u2026.oh, my God , you knew what happened\u2026\u201d\u00a0Anita stopped\u00a0suddenly\u00a0speaking, as if she was breathless. She seemed too agitated\u00a0to be able to continue her story\u00a0( to tell).\u00a0\u201c Look, if Sofia\u2019s cat\u00a0didn\u2019t attack ( catch)\u00a0that pigeon, it was probably because, as you said, it was old and run down \u00a0so that the cat was not interested in hunting it. The cat knew, or rather felt the old pigeon wouldn\u2019t be good to eat\u201d Sara said, with nonchalance. \u201c Oh, but Mouse didn\u2019t just not \u00a0grab ( catch) the pigeon,\u00a0the cat even started licking the pigeon!\u00a0Mouse licked\u00a0its head and its body, oh, you saw!\u00a0And the pigeon, as the cat was licking\u00a0it, gave it \u00a0very light pecks, right with\u00a0the tip of the beak, as of to return the favor\u2026Oh, what a sight\u2026.I stayed there completely stunned \u2026\u201d Anita was talking \u00a0going up and down the room , with an enchanted look, as if\u00a0she still had \u00a0the cat and the pigeon under her eyes, \u00a0while they were\u00a0cuddled each other.\u00a0\u201c \u00a0Come on, I really don\u2019t find ( see) anything so extraordinary in it\u201d Sara commented. \u201c It maybe the cat licked the pigeon to know \u00a0\u00a0if it was edible.\u00a0And the pigeon, on its part, pecked the cat to make it understand\u00a0that it \u00a0\u00a0had still the beak to defend itself\u00a0if the cat intended to eat it.\u201d \u00a0\u201c Ah, I see you don\u2019t understand\u2026but you should have been there, seeing them with your own eyes. They would have moved you too\u201d Anita sighed, sorry for\u00a0the skepticism\u00a0with which her mother commented on the story \u00a0of that for her \u00a0was something\u00a0absolutely extraordinary , incredible for herself, if she hadn\u2019t seen it with her own eyes. \u00a0\u201c But I didn\u2019t tell you everything, there is still more \u201c \u00a0Anita said, and kept on telling, undaunted.\u00a0\u201c After having been an almost long time the cat to lick the pigeon and the pigeon\u00a0to reciprocate with very light pecks, the two animals started walking, side by side , on the edge of the courtyard. They \u00a0were quite distant from the other animals\u00a0present there in the courtyard, at which they ( the cat and the pigeon) \u00a0now and then, cast a glance, as if to make sure that no one of those others\u00a0were approaching them. Oh, it was really a wonder, truly enchanting\u00a0to see Mouse and the pigeon , as they walked, turn they heads, point their muzzle or beak at\u00a0those over there, to make sure those there stayed at a safe distance, that those there weren\u2019t going to bother them.\u201d\u00a0Anita fell silent suddenly, as if she was out of breath. She kept\u00a0looking\u00a0insistently at her mother, who\u00a0continued to stand bent over\u00a0the stove, without saying a word, without looking at her.\u00a0\u201c Ah, you had seen them \u201c Anita came back telling \u201c They walked side by side and, now and then, they stopped \u00a0and stood facing each other\u2026and they started talking, maybe even arguing\u2026Oh, I swear \u00a0that really it seemed they were talking \u201c Anita kept telling more and more enthusiast. \n\u201c Ah, then the cat and the pigeon were talking ( Or: but well, you saw the cat and the pigeon that were talking)\u2026.and, let\u2019s hear, what language were they speaking?\u201d Sara snorted, who seemed not to want\u00a0to give much weight ( importance) to what Anita was telling.\u00a0\u201c Oh, Mom, but what \u00a0a question! \u00a0When I say\u00a0that\u00a0Mouse and the pigeon\u00a0were talking, I don\u2019t mean they really spoke\u2026. Of course ,\u00a0at least they didn\u2019t speak\u00a0a language made up with words, and, in any case, not even ( made) of gestures and sounds that I could understand. Yet I bet\u00a0they were talking, like two friends can do during a walk\u201d \nSara was not at all impressed by what Anita told her about Mouse and that ( the) pigeon, as she thought that her daughter was exaggerating the extent of what she had seen, that she had become too enthusiastic. Yet something really unusual (\u00a0rare), even if not \u00a0entirely extraordinary,\u00a0had truly happened\u00a0between that great\u00a0curious playful which was \u00a0Mouse ,the cat of the extravagant Sofia , and that lame and battered \u00a0\u00a0pigeon to which no one\u00a0had thought to give a name. No one, but perhaps except Mouse. Who knows how\u00a0the cat Mouse called that pigeon. Since Mouse and the lame pigeon\u00a0had become friends. \nIt had happened that\u00a0that old pigeon, when he was already lame, but was still able to fly, in one of its last flights, had landed\u00a0right in the courtyard\u00a0in front of Marianne\u2019s house. For the old pigeon, lame and\u00a0run down ,it had been a real fortune. In the courtyard \u00a0there were hens, chickens , ducks, all animals\u00a0which were regularly\u00a0given to eat, that is to peck, so that the old and battered pigeon\u00a0could it too\u00a0find something to peck. In that courtyard.\nMouse\u00a0( the cat Mouse) which was everyday roaming\u00a0around in the countryside,\u00a0was an habitu\u00e9 of the courtyard in front of Marianna\u2019s house, where, you could say, he knew one by one the hens, the chickens the ducks, the turkeys. Ah, how much he ( the cat) liked\u00a0to run after the hens, to make them run away, as if he was giving them the hunt. \u00a0And it happened that sometimes the cat received also some\u00a0\u00a0pecks, not at all light, from the hens. But when they, the hens, stretched out their beaks, he\u00a0pulled out\u00a0his claws. It was he, Mouse, which ran away\u00a0scared ( frightened) when the geese, arranged in a team,\u00a0stretching their long necks, started to chase him, cackling at full beak.\nHere, it was ( had been) in this courtyard that, one day, Mouse had seen\u00a0the lame pigeon. He had seen thepigeon\u00a0while it ( the pigeon) was standing aloof\u00a0from the other animals, , moving only a little \u00a0its head, which seemed fearful. Mouse was a great hunter, even\u00a0of pigeons, of course, which he found very tasty to eat. Ah, their meat was delicious, both raw and cooked.\u00a0Yes, since Mouse had also eaten\u00a0( tasted) the pigeon cooked. \u00a0She, his great friend Sofia, oh, she could\u00a0cook the pigeon in different very tasty ways. He , MOUSE\u00a0could\u00a0not but help be sorry that Sofia cooked only pigeons\u00a0she went to take from that there, that horrible guy wearing a bloody apron, ah\u2026she\u00a0came home with pigeons already dead and\u00a0plucked \u2026.Ah, if she\u00a0had cooked the pigeons he hunted, instead! Mouse had also\u00a0brought ( taken) the pigeons he had caught into house, but Sofia oh, had looked\u00a0at him angry, she had\u00a0sent him, with the pigeon out of house\u2026. \nSo, as soon as Mouse\u00a0saw that pigeon \u00a0there, almost at the end of the courtyard , he , since he was a ca( as a cat he was) widened his eyes , rolled\u00a0( rubbed) his claws\u00a0on the ground, ready , indeed impatient\u00a0to launch into the attack. And he left\u00a0as fast as a lightening : he knew he had to grab the beast ( pigeon)\u00a0before it could take off.\u00a0And yet that pigeon\u00a0hadn\u2019t taken off at all. It \u00a0hadn\u2019t even tried to escape, it had moved only a bit, but Mouse \u00a0could then notice that the pigeon\u00a0was lame. \u00a0\u00a0The cat\u00a0had swooped down on the pigeon , ready to grab \u00a0it \u00a0with his claws, ready to pierce \u00a0it \u00a0with his teeth, oh, but that smell\u2026.that smell which took your breath away\u2026.A musty, stinking sewage\u00a0smell,\u00a0emanated \u00a0from the pigeon, had made him ( Mouse)\u00a0soon give up his prey. \u00a0Mouse was trembling \u00a0with fear, as he left the pigeon slip out of his claws . Since that lame, balding pigeon , with even a not bright eye, not only would it \u00a0not have been good to eat, but it \u00a0was a danger too. That smell\u00a0of \u00a0acidic slime , but, at the same time\u00a0of mold, which emanated from the pigeon\u00a0for him ( Mouse)\u00a0meant DANGER! Warning\u00a0DANGER!\u00a0The lame pigeon was plagued\u00a0and it \u00a0would have plagued him too! Mouse\u00a0had not only given up on hunting\u00a0it \u00a0, he had escaped from that plagued animal, since he did not want\u00a0to be plagued ( he) too.\u00a0Sofia\u2019s cat had escaped\u00a0away, even if he hadn\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0started running.\u00a0Mouse had\u00a0gone away, taking \u00a0that long step, stretching his front legs out before him, that same step he took when he was\u00a0pursued by the\u00a0cackling geese.\u00a0So the cat had crossed the courtyard, his front legs stretched forward, in a very short time. When he was going to leave the courtyard, Mouse\u00a0could not help but glance behind him.\u00a0Oh, he saw that the lame and stinking pigeon with its uncertain, hesitant steps, and limping, was moving ( walking) towards him! Yes, the lame, stinking pigeon was following\u00a0him!\u00a0Sure, it ( the pigeon) was still at a considerable distance from him, but if it \u00a0had\u00a0started flying, he\u00a0could reach him in an instant ( immediately) Yeah, if the pigeon\u00a0would\u00a0take flight\u2026But why it didn\u2019t fly? That pigeon hadn\u2019t even taken flight \u00a0when he\u00a0was about to catch it .Then the lame pigeon couldn\u2019t even fly, Mouse realized.\nIf Anita had been remained\u00a0very amazed and even very much moved\u00a0by the meeting of Mouse with the lame pigeon, which she had happened to witness, who knows how she would have remained if she could have\u00a0seen what happened that day, when Mouse and the lame pigeon, they had seen each other ( they had met) for the first time. Ah, what happened then, in that courtyard\u00a0crowded with animals, only they, the animals\u00a0which were in the courtyard, could \u00a0know ( witness). Not a dog passed which could see ( what was\u00a0happening). \nMouse had just realized\u00a0that the foul-smelling pigeon\u00a0could not fly, and, forgetting that he had to get away from\u00a0it, in order not to be plagued, he stood looking \u00a0at\u00a0the pigeon as \u00a0it trudged, laboriously, limping, towards him. The pigeon was stretching its neck, was stretching its beak towards him. Here, it seemed that the pigeon was saying something\u00a0to him, Mouse, yes, just with its beak, that was pointed at him.\u00a0With its beak, not with its eyes, the lame , stinking\u00a0pigeon was saying something\u00a0to him.\u00a0Mouse couldn\u2019t understand \u00a0what the pigeon was saying to him, but he was sure that the damned beast was saying something just to him. \u00a0Meanwhile the\u00a0cackling\u00a0geese attacked\u00a0the lame pigeon with their strong beaks. The geese, cackling louder than ever, were tearing off its feathers, giving it ( the poor beast) big pecks. Then \u00a0Mouse, it could be said\u00a0that he was the one\u00a0which took off.\u00a0In a flash he \u00a0was next\u00a0to the lame pigeon , and he lashed out furiously,\u00a0on the geese, clawing and biting them.\u00a0The cat\u2019s intervention\u00a0had to surprise a lot\u00a0the geese, which closed their beaks , gave up the poor pigeon and, muted, moved away, with their tails between their legs. \nThe lame pigeon, battered\u00a0more than ever, quite plucked, and Mouse stood\u00a0facing each other\u00a0for an almost long time, and perhaps\u00a0they said something each other , with their eyes, with minimal gestures. The pigeon craned its neck up and, with its beak in the air, made a sound which was not the usual cooing of pigeons, but rather a kind of cry.\u00a0Mouse raised a paw, as if\u00a0to place it on the pigeon, but then soon withdrew\u00a0it and held ( placed) it on his chest.\u00a0It seemed that the two animals \u00a0were making a pact, an agreement between them.\u00a0And this was happening\u00a0while all the other animals in the yard ( crowding the yard) moved away from them.\n \n \n \n \n \n "}

{"title": "Tony\u2019s Picnic    - Another Tony Adventure", "story": "Tony, Antonia\u2019s stuffed panda, tried to control his excitement. He watched the commotion of prepping for a family excursion to the woods. \u00a0Anticipation made him quiver with excitement. Not wanting to be left behind, he sat amidst the chaos.\nTony always wanted to go on a picnic and \u2018Get back to the land,\u2019 as the song said. Only Tony heard, \u2018get back to bamboo.\u2019 Either way, he wanted to reconnect with his roots. Especially if they were bamboo roots. \nAntonia placed Tony atop the wicker picnic basket. \nShe called out, \u201cMom! That\u2019s everything!\u201d She went to the car. Tony held his breath until placed safely between Antonia and her little sister Cindy. \nJane, their mother, sat behind the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cAll aboard! Everyone present and accounted for? Seat belts?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Dolly!\u201d Cindy cried in a panic. \u201cShe was here! We can\u2019t go!\u201d \nTony sighed. Dolly could never resist making a problem. \nJane rested her head on the steering wheel and counted to ten.\nAntonia said, \u201cDon\u2019t sit there crying. Go find her.\u201d\n\u201cBut I brought her! She was right here!\u201d\nJane said, \u201cEveryone stay put.\u201d She stepped out, opened the back of the SUV and rummaged. \nCindy sniffed. \nTony hoped Dolly wasn\u2019t lost. The picnic would be cancelled. He would miss her, of course. But he really wanted to go on the picnic. \nAntonia said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Tony says she\u2019s around. We\u2019ll find her, Cin.\u201d\nJane opened Cindy\u2019s side of the car. \n\u201cThere she is! Right under your feet.\u201d She retrieved Dolly from the floor and smoothed her dress. \u201cBuried in with the jackets. Guess it was too cool for her.\u201d She passed Dolly to Cindy, kissed her head and shut the door.\n\u201cTony says, \u2018Too cool for the room.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe does not! She just fell.\u201d\nJane got in and started the car. \u201cSeat belts, everyone! Especially Dolly and Tony.\u201d\nAntonia said, \u201cGot \u2018em, Mom.\u201d She whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t be such a drama queen, Cindy. You know Tony\u2019s humor.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he says what you can\u2019t get away with.\u201d\n\u201cTony says he can speak for himself.\u201d\n\u201cThen let him. You stay out of it.\u201d\n\u201cStop bickering, or I\u2019ll turn the car around.\u201d\nThey were on their way.\nArriving at the picnic spot, they unpacked the car and found a sunny spot in a meadow. Beautiful trees towered around the clearing. A chorus of birds sang. The girls had never been to the forest. They lay on the grass, pointing at clouds while Jane prepared lunch. \nCindy said, \u201cI see a pig.\u201d\nAntonia pointed. \u201cSee the duck?\u201d\nCindy held Dolly\u2019s arm up. \u201cLook, a sheep.\u201d\n\u201cTony wonders why no one sees a panda.\u201d\nCindy pointed at Tony. \u201cI see you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTony means in the clouds.\u201d\nCindy asserted, \u201cTony, clouds aren\u2019t black and white.\u201d\n\u201cTony asked if they have to be fluffy farm animals.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re clouds, Tony.\u201d \n\u201cTony sees an airplane.\u201d\nCindy became impatient. \u201cThat is an airplane.\u201d\n\u201cTony says he knows. He saw it first.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s silly. Even Dolly sees it\u2019s not a cloud.\u201d\n\u201cTony asked, do they have to be fluffy and smell bad? Or just fluffy?\u201d\nCindy looked over to her mother. \u201cMom!\u201d \nJane held a finger up. \u201cJust a minute, kids\u2026\u201d\nCindy scoffed. \u201cClouds don\u2019t smell bad, Tony.\u201d\n\u201cFarm animals do.\u201d\nJane called out. \u201cCome and get it\u2026!\u201d \nCindy scrambled to her feet and ran to the picnic. \u201c\u2019Bout time\u2026!\u201d\nAntonia said, \u201cTony sees a sandwich.\u201d\nThe picnic went well. The tuna burgers were delicious. They finished the big bag of potato chips. \nCindy said, \u201cThe perfect mix of pickles and mayo, Mom.\u201d\nAntonia said, \u201cTony wishes there\u2019d been more bamboo.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Cindy. Tell Tony I\u2019ll address that on the next picnic.\u201d\nAfter lunch, the girls languished. \nJane stood and clapped her hands. \u201cLet\u2019s explore for acorns and visit the lake.\u201d\nAntonia set Tony atop the picnic basket. \u201cKeep look-out, Tony. Don\u2019t let anyone take our stuff.\u201d Tony stared fiercely into the distance.\nCindy propped Dolly back-to-back with Tony. She hoped Dolly could sweeten Tony\u2019s sharp tongue.\nThe sisters followed their mother and disappeared into the trees. \nTony watched them go. He held his gaze, determined to scare off intruders.\nJane led her daughters to the ridge overlooking the lake. \n\u201cLook kids\u2026 What do you see?\u201d\nThey saw three raccoons, a mother and two kits, moving away through a clearing.\n\u201cWow!\u201d They thrilled at seeing animals in the wild.\nBack at the picnic spot. Tony saw the raccoons approach. He didn\u2019t know what they wanted but he knew he must resist them.\nThe raccoons methodically hunted the site. Smelling food, they knocked Tony and Dolly off the basket and rummaged through it. They took what they could carry and then circling, sniffed Tony. He held still as possible.\nThe mother raccoon, Bazile, grunted. \nTony said, \u201cTake me, if you must. But leave Dolly. She\u2019s useless. I mean, she\u2019s no use to you.\u201d\nBazile slung Tony onto her back and lumbered toward the trees. \u00a0Tony whooped and hollered as he bounced along. Her two little ones followed closely. \nBack in the forest, the raccoons scampered up an ancient oak. They ate and slept where three large branches split from the trunk. \nBazile placed Tony in the center. Unusual sounds, from above, drew their attention. \u00a0Three chirping blue birds circled over Tony\u2019s head, trailing bright ribbons from their beaks. In awe, Tony could only watch. \nBazile and her kits left food at his feet, bowing in homage. \nThis completely surprised Tony. Expecting to get eaten, they honored him like royalty.\nHe thought, \u2018T\nUnsure of the etiquette such situations required, Tony assumed a noble pose. Holding his head up, he nodded, acknowledging the raccoon\u2019s tribute.\nHe said, \u201cCall me King Tut Tut.\u201d\nA scream drew their attention to the base of the tree. \nThere, Antonia ran in circles, pointing and wailing. Her shouting attracted others. Children and parents gathered and looked into the tree. \nTony and the raccoons stared back.\nA park ranger named Greg arrived in his truck to assess the situation. \nClutching her mother\u2019s skirts, Antonia whimpered and fretted over Tony\u2019s safety. \nCindy said, \u201cWho\u2019s the drama queen now?\u201d Holding Dolly close they gazed into the branches above.\nAntonia ignored her. She pleaded Tony\u2019s case to Ranger Greg. \n\u201cPlease save him, Mr. Ranger. He\u2019s my Tony Panda. I\u2019ve had him forever.\u201d\nJane\u2019s imploring look confirmed Tony\u2019s importance to Antonia. Grunting, he nodded and set about rescuing Tony.\nHe fetched some climbing equipment from his truck, including heavy duty web belts utility workers use to climb electrical poles. After attaching cleats to his boots, he fed the belt around the tree and secured it to his harness. Greg worked his way up the tree to where the trunk branched off. \nBy the time he got there, mother Bazile and her kits had fled to safety further up the tree. \nGreg pulled himself up to find Tony glaring at him. \nTony thought, \nThe ranger grabbed Tony. \u2018\n\u2019 \nGreg didn\u2019t respond. He tucked Tony behind the strap and descended to the base of the tree. Antonia gratefully took Tony into her arms and squeezed him. \n\u201cOh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Ranger!\u201d\nApplause from on lookers made Antonia hold Tony up. She\u2019d never seen him look so happy.\nJane told Greg, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much this means. You saved the day.\u201d\nGreg demurred, \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the job\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything we can do\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. It was kind of fun. The raccoons didn\u2019t mistreat Tony. Looks like they took care of him.\u201d\nTony thought, \u2018\n\u2019\nGreg left and the crowd dispersed. Jane and the girls strolled back to their picnic spot. \nAntonia placed Tony safe on the grass by the car. \u201cNow, you stay here, Tony.\u201d\nJane and the girls packed the car. Their day was waning. \nTony sat and watched them. He thought, \u2018\n\u2019 It had gotten warm. He began to itch. He wondered, \u2018\n\u2019 \nHe noticed an ant crawling on his foot. He said, \u201cDo you know where I could get some bamboo to munch on?\u201d\nPacked and ready, Jane did a quick inventory. \u201cPicnic basket, cooler, blanket\u2026 anything else? Cindy, you have Dolly?\u201d\n\u201cSafe in the back seat, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cAntonia\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u201d\nShe ran frantically around the SUV and fell to her knees, looking under the car.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Tony! Cindy, what did you\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t touch your grubby bear.\u201d\nJane asked, \u201cWhere did you put him?\u201d\n\u201cHe was right here! Where could he be?\u201d Antonia began to wail.\n\u201cNow what\u2026?\u201d Jane walked around the car and sighed. \u201cStop whining, Antonia. He must be nearby\u2026\u201d Shielding her eyes from the setting sun, Jane scanned their surroundings. \nShe gasped and pointed. \u201cThere!\u201d\nAntonia followed her gaze. At the bend in the path they saw Tony lying on his back, moving slowly away. Antonia sprinted to him and screamed. \nA swarm of ants carried him.\nShe picked Tony up and began brushing ants off of him.\nWith each slap, Tony said, \u201c\nHolding him tightly, Antonia returned to the car. She secured him in the back seat, next to Cindy.\nJane asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nAntonia shook her head. \u201cAnts had him. They were taking him toward the bamboo by the stream.\u201d\n\u201cThat Tony. What can you do?\u201d\nThey laughed, got into the car and went home.\n "}
{"title": "Ye Olde Library", "story": "It was a foggy afternoon in the city. Claire had finished her shift at the convenience store and was making her way back home. Having lived in the city for so long, she had gotten to know all the short cuts and alleyways. She made her way towards one of the alleyways, but instead was greeted by a red sign saying \u2018Road works\u2019. Claire huffed, before turning on her heels and walking towards another of the alleyways\nShe rarely used this route, as it was longer than her usual walk, but also the roads were cobbled which made them difficult to walk on. Through the fog, she saw a dim light on the right-hand side of the road. As she got closer, she realised the light was emitting from a small store. A sign hung from a metal frame jutting out of the wall. It was square with gold writing inked onto it, reading \u2018Ye Olde Library\u2019. This sparked Claire\u2019s interested. She looked at her watch, she had plenty of time to kill before she needed to get home, so she wandered over.\nThe store itself seemed to almost blend in with the rest of the houses that surrounded it, had it not been for the sign above it. The wooden framework had worn away in places. Filigree that was once carved into the wood were now just lumps and grooves. A message hung loosely in the window, even the paint on that had come away in patches. It read \u2018Open\u2019. Claire put her hand on the door and pushed.\nAs Claire entered the store, a small chime came from the bell above as it rattled against the door. Claire looked up; a semicircle had been worn into the door from the years of the bell moving across it. Inside the store, the books appeared to be worn down as well, covered in a thin layer of dust. But there were so many books. Books stacked in the shelves; sideways, vertical and slanted. Books piled on the floor, taking up almost all the walking space that there was. The place itself was so small, the books made it even more cramped. The wooden floorboards had worn away in areas, while other areas still maintained their varnish. These were more obvious in corners and against walls where books had been piled. The wooden framework extended to the interior as well. Everything was the same colour of brown throughout, though the golden light from the oil lamp styled light fixtures made it seem homely.\nShe picked up one of the nearby books and examined the cover, attempting to beneath the dust that had settled on it. She opened it and flipped through the pages. As she did so, a cloud erupted from it. Claire was taken aback by this eruption and began to cough. Then she heard footsteps. They seemed to be coming from the back of the library, perhaps even down some stairs. As the steps moved closer, the floorboards began to creak. The steps were heavy and deep. A figure then rounded the corner.\nClaire audibly gasped. Before her stood a tall man, made taller still by the slight incline of the floor. He barely fit through the frame of the doorway; his shoulders touched the sides and he had to duck to get under. He was bulky all over, his arms and legs like trucks of trees. His face was hidden beneath a cloud of beard. It cascaded over his chin and rested on top of a pile of books he was holding. His hair was greying, but below his burrowing brows were kind, blue eyes. His hair was pulled back by a headscarf, exposing his forehead. His clothes were dusty, worn and tattered. They seemed to match the rest of the interior of the library.\n\u201cSorry to keep you waitin\u2019, pet\u201d He chirped. His voice was much lighter than Claire was expecting. He turned on his heels and dropped the pile of books on top of another that was next to him. A cloud of dust exploded from under it as the piles met.\n\u201cIt- It\u2019s ok,\u201d Claire mumbled, pulling the book away from her face so she could peer over it. \u201cI was only browsing.\u201d\n\u201cThen carry on!\u201d He chortled. He went back under the door frame and into the rear again. Claire, still peeping over the top of the book, relaxed. She hadn\u2019t realised how stiff she had gone suddenly. She exhaled, looking back down at the book she had in her hands.\nAfter some time, she put the book back on top of the pile and reached for another. Before long, she had looked through several books and had them piling up at her feet. The minutes seemed to fly by in this place. Many of these books were very old, dating back some decades. The pages had yellowed, and the spines had started to weaken in placed. Yet, they all seemed to be well cared for. She scooped up her selection of books, waddled up the inclining floor and hovered at the doorway to the rear of the store.\n\u201cThis is a cute place.\u201d She said, struggling to hold everything in her arms.\n\u201cAye, it is!\u201d The man called back. Claire peered around the corner of the door and to the right were some spiral, wooden stairs. His voice was coming from down here \u201cDon\u2019t get many visitors mind you though.\u201d He continued. The floor began to creek as he forced himself up the narrow stairwell to be level with Claire.\n\u201cIs it yours?\u201d She asked, still processing what she just saw. He reminded her of sausage meat being squeezed into its casings, or a cat pushing itself under a door. For a big man, he seemed successful at getting through tight spaces.\n\u201cNay, it\u2019s not. I volunteer here a few days a week.\u201d He smiled proudly. He pulled himself up the final few steps, his hands gripping onto the railings. Claire felt her face drop when she saw the size of his hands, they could cover her whole face, she thought. She quickly batted the idea away and resumed her gaze with the man.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she said, her voice slightly wavered from holding the books for so long.\n\u201cOh, lass! Ye should \u2018ave said.\u201d The man said, taking the books from Claire\u2019s arms. Claire rung her arms out, getting the blood to flow back through them again. \u201cWould ye like to borrow these?\u201d He lifted the pile, gesturing to Claire. She nodded in receipt.\n\u201cHow long have you worked here for?\u201d She enquired. He smiled down at her.\n\u201cMany years, pet, this place keeps me sane. This and me gardenin\u2019,\u201d He replied. \u201cBefore that I was a builder. Quite the career change, no?\u201d He laughed. Claire nodded feebly in response; her eyes widened in awe.\nHe signalled for her to move backward, gesturing to the doorway. She began to shuffle backward. As he went through, she pushed her body against the wall, her legs rubbing against the piles of books behind her. The man walked over to the opposite wall. He balanced the pile of books in one hand and leaned down, the other reaching between book piles on the floor. He pulled out a bag, which looked as if it had been stuck there a while. With a shake, it shed enough dust to coat the books in another layer of grey.\nClaire moved off from the wall and felt movement behind her knees. She quickly grabbed down, stopping the books from wavering too much. The pile furthest from her began to wobble. She stuck out her foot and tried to hook it onto it, but a couple of the books on top dropped down. The landed with a thud against the floor, another puff of dust erupted from it. This alerted the man, who snapped his head round to the source of the noise. He could see Claire awkwardly squatted on the floor, one leg outstretched and her arms flailing over the piles. He gave out a bellowing laugh. He pulled the bag handle over his wrist, took a small stamp from his pocket, grabbed the top book from the pile in his other hand, flipped over the cover and began stamping. Once the pile was depleted and in the bag, he moved over to Claire. He grabbed hold of her jacket and lifted her back to her feet. She squealed, grabbing hold of his huge hand in some attempt at restraint. He let go of her before bending down and picking up the two books that had falling.\n\u201cWant to borrow these too, eh?\u201d He laughed again, dropping those into the bag as well. Claire looked over herself, she was now covered in patches of dust. No wonder he looks so rugged, she thought, shaking off and brushing down her clothes. The man held out the bag, to which Claire took it. She grunted under its weight, surprised by how heavy it was. He made it seem so effortless.\n\u201cWhen do I bring them back?\u201d Claire stammered, lifting the bag onto her shoulder. A wide grin spread across the man\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhen ye like. Always \u2018ave more for ye to read!\u201d He beamed, crossing his arms over his chest. Claire smiled back at him. There was a moment of silence between the two, before Claire looked down at her watch.\n\u201cOh! I must get home!\u201d She exclaimed. The man laughed once more, moving sideways to allow Claire entrance to get through. She waded her way between his body and the books, making it rather miraculously to the door without anything else falling over.\n\u201cSee you soon pet\u201d The man said, taking his hand out of its cross to wave and putting it back again.\n\u201cBye! I\u2019ll come back again soon, promise!\u201d Claire smiled, opening the door and jumping through. She waved back, allowing the door to close on its own. She turned to her right and continued up the cobbled path. The man watched her go, sighing happily to himself before turning and ducking back under the doorway.\nOnce home, dinner eaten and chores done, Claire sat down on her armchair. She pulled out one of the books she had obtained earlier and dusted off the cover. With a cup of tea in hand, she flipped over the cover and snuggled in and began to read. How excellent that my normal route home was blocked today, she mused."}
{"title": "Humanity On Trial", "story": "We were asked to give our disquisition on humanity. So here it is. This shall be brief. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve been asked about our position on the creation of man. Our stance was unanimous. We still think they\u2019re hostile. Belligerent. They were a primitive race light years ago. Racing against the sands of time to evolve. To prosper. To adapt in a world that\u2019s truly fitter without them. And now, they have perished. They are forgotten. Their memory has long been woven into the fabrics of space and time. This is an assessment of their reign as a dominant species on Earth.\u00a0\nDuring the times of fire and stone, humans were scarce in numbers. They coexisted with the rest of Earth\u2019s inhabitants because they had to. Once their numbers started increasing, so did their insatiable appetite for war. For oppression. Let me ask this, has their appetite seized ever since? Unfortunately, the answer is no. They have continued their unfathomable blood shed until the very end. It is unquestionably dreary. We had wished they achieved self-consciousness, but it was far reached. And the ones who did achieve it were treated defectively. As though they were the anomaly. Sad, indeed.\u00a0\nNevertheless, there has been incidents of rectitude. Virtue, and benevolence. We will not deny those. Humans are eccentric\u2013\u2013in their own way. They are capable of obtaining wisdom. But they are very poor at sharing it. They can feign cruelty, but behind it nestles fragility. These traits have plagued us. They can be selfish. Yet they can be very kind to one another. There is no denying that at times humans thoroughly surprised us. A few occurrences of manifold are worthy of mentioning. It involves their invaluable acts of kindness. They have shown great mercy towards wildlife, towards the trees and towards the land. They have also shown bountiful charity towards their own kind. To the needy, to the homeless and to the ill. But alas, the senseless acts of violence surpassed all good. The killing. The barbarity. We say this with a heavy heart. We couldn\u2019t bear to watch.\u00a0\nThere is of course the story of Henri the Brute. He was a man of many names, but we chose this one in the purpose of this disquisition. He lived at the time of Atlantis. A time when ancient nations were at their peaked glory. A time when beasts and dragons freely roamed Upper Earth. He was a man of great skill and deception. He had killed many of his kind. Too many to count. But when we peered into his heart, we only found remorse. We found penitence. It was a surprise to us all. How can slaughter and compassion come hand in hand? One day, he was riding back to Toria after enduring a long battle. He chanced upon a little girl. She was alone. Bare foot and out of sorts. Henri steered the reigns of his horse and trotted closer. Curiosity getting the best of him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat brings you to the outskirts of my village, little girl? All alone. Are you waiting for someone?\u201d\u00a0\nThe girl looked up but said nothing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I asked you a question.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for Lord Henri the Brute.\u201d\nHenri cocked an eyebrow at the little girl. \u201cI am him. What is it you need?\u201d\n\u201cI come with tidings. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTidings? From my army in the South?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d said the girl, almost instantly. \u201cTidings from the underworld. I\u2019m afraid your people\u2019s time has come, Henri the Brute. Toria will perish.\u201d\nHenri\u2019s heart battered behind his chest. \u201cMy village will perish. By whom?\u201d\n\u201cThe armies of Goltic will arrive at dawn. You have no time to prepare for what\u2019s coming. Their armies are massive. No man, child or kine will be spared.\u201d\u00a0\nHenri\u2019s fright turned to anger. \u201cThis is madness. The people of my village have done nothing wrong. They\u2019re not like me. I\u2019m a bloodless warrior, they\u2019re nothing but credulous farmers and fishermen. There must be a way to turn this around. There\u2019s still time!\u201d\n\u201cIt is what it is. There is no coming back from it. Your village will perish tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0\nHe stared at her. Round-eyed, yet steadfast. \u201cNo.\u201d He demanded. \u201cThere has to be something I can do.\u201d\nThe girl was quiet for a single moment. Then she smirked. \u201cThere is but one thing. The masters of the underworld are willing to exchange the people\u2019s souls for yours. You have killed a great deal. Your soul is worth a thousand so far. Give us your soul instead, and Toria will be spared.\u201d\u00a0\nHenri was at a crossroads. The man who\u2019d killed a thousand was now concerned with the lives of mere hundreds. There was surely no way he\u2019d agree to this trade. But as we said earlier, humans continue to surprise us. Henri agreed. His village was spared, and his soul was traded in their place. It was an act of pure kindness. Despite his bloodstained past.\u00a0\nSo, this remains our question. Was Henri\u2019s sacrifice enough to tip the scales in humanity\u2019s favor? Was it enough to counterbalance the defilement they unleashed upon their planet, their biosphere? Was it enough to atone for their butchery, their carnage? As generous as it was, we\u2019re afraid it is not enough. Let us remind you, oh Great Divine, of the tales of Picard Magnus. A man so cruel, he\u2019d forgotten what it was that made him human. He liberated the offender and prosecuted the victim. Massacre was but a sport to him. A ruler that bathed in the blood of children. Drank to the collapse of democracy and cheered the decapitation of justice.\u00a0\nWhen his army burned down the flourishing city of Lanceud, a squire came running to his side.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cLord, the people in this church are said to be believers of God. Shall we not spare them?\u201d\u00a0\nPicard, tugging his lips in an ugly snarl, said, \u201cNo, kill them all. Their God will recognize his own.\u201d\nAs a conclusion, we believe that humans have done far more wrongdoing than they have fairness. They have done far more aggression than they have clemency. We regret to inform you, oh Great Divine, that humankind, as a species, has failed. We say this with a hefty heart. For we know how much you cherished their existence. You had considerable plans for them. But they have failed you. They have failed us all.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been long due that we offer our disquisition. We have assessed many, no endless of worldly and unworldly beings. Ancient civilizations. Peoples. None has come to compare to what humans have done. The betrayals. The genocides. The wars. The secrets. It\u2019s haunted us for epochs. Now, we are unfettered to speak our peace. We only wish our word comes with admission.\u00a0\u00a0\nSigned and agreed upon,\u00a0"}
{"title": "Sue's Place", "story": "Not too long ago, in a town like most other towns, there was an atrociously terrible restaurant. The food was bland, usually undercooked or overcooked (whichever you liked least), and served in messy heaps on stained dishes. But they had good coffee.\nIt just so happened that a secret agent was assigned to watch this restaurant. Suspicious activity had been reported.\nTrina\u2014a good, unassuming name for a perfectly normal young woman\u2014threw a glance over the streaky windows and crooked sign that identified this as \u201cSue\u2019s Place\u201d. She tugged on the hem of her good, unassuming hoodie and tucked her perfectly normal auburn hair behind her ears, then pushed open the door.\nA bell rang as she walked into the restaurant. She blinked and waited for her eyes to adjust. One lightbulb in the corner was flickering, and a few were completely out. There was no music playing.\nThe tables were crooked. Some had only three chairs even though the table had four sides. Near the left wall, two tables were shoved together, and all the extra chairs were crowded around them until it looked like the aftermath of Christmas dinner with a side of politics.\u00a0\nThe door behind the counter opened, and for a moment the warm sounds and smells of a kitchen reached Trina as a little old lady bustled out. She was wearing a stained apron and huge shoes and a sweet smile. She called Trina \u201cdearie\u201d and told her to take a seat, then went back into the kitchen without taking her order. Trina sat and waited.\u00a0\nWhile she did this very important part of detective work, two boys came in. They were very raggedy-looking, with raggedy clothes and raggedy hair and raggedy shoes. They didn\u2019t sit at a table or go to the counter; instead, one boy grabbed a broom from the corner and stared sweeping. The other boy helped him by moving the chairs and tables out of the way.\u00a0\nTrina watched them carefully. They seemed to be paying special attention to the corner with the flickering light switch. The boy moving the chairs crouched down to hold the dustpan, but he seemed to be having an issue with the pocket of his raggedy jeans.\u00a0\nThen the little old lady came back through the door with a full plate and cup in her hand. She bustled over to Trina\u2019s table and put them down, then wiped her hands on her stained apron and gave her another sweet smile.\u00a0\nTrina frowned a little at the greyish pile on the plate in front of her. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t order yet.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right, dearie. I mixed this up for you right quickly.\u201d The little old lady pulled out the chair across from Trina and looked her up and down, inspecting her good, unassuming hoodie and perfectly normal auburn hair.\u00a0\nTrina took a forkful of the grey stuff in her plate. It tasted like cold mashed potatoes with overcooked tuna, and she took a drink of water to wash it down. The little old lady was still talking, asking where she was from. She was just about to invent an elaborate lie when the door bell rang. The raggedy cleanup crew was leaving.\u00a0\nThe little old lady\u2014who had introduced herself as the famous Sue\u2014noticed her glance at the closing door. \u201cI tell you, there\u2019s no such thing as good help nowadays. They would probably say I don\u2019t pay them enough to sweep the whole floor. Now, you\u2019ve cleaned out your plate! Would you like some more?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I mean, um, no, that was enough. I\u2019m full. Thank you.\u201d\nSue took her plate and cup. \u201cWhere are you heading off to?\u201d\nTrina patted her bag. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve brought my laptop. I was hoping to get some work done. If you don\u2019t mind me in your space, that is.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, dearie! In fact, I\u2019ll bring you a coffee.\u201d\nNo protesting could defer Sue from her purpose, and she bustled back to the kitchen. Just before she got there, though, the bell rang again, and a skinny girl with tangled hair walked in. Right behind her was a big, burly man. The girl looked scared, and Trina tensed.\nSue smiled sweetly at them. \u201cLindsay! Right on time for your shift. Thanks for dropping her off, Mark!\u201d\u00a0\nThe burly man dubbed Mark nodded and left. The girl wrapped her skinny arms around herself, and Sue ushered her into the kitchen. Trina shot a text to Gary\u2014one of her outside guys\u2014to watch the back door. Something wasn\u2019t right. But then the kitchen door opened, and the skinny girl brought over her coffee. Her hand shook and her tangled hair was hanging in her face, so Trina wasn\u2019t surprised at all when some of the coffee spilled onto the table. The girl didn\u2019t even apologize, just ran back to the kitchen.\u00a0\nThe coffee that stayed in the cup was actually really good. Gary said the back door hadn\u2019t moved. Supper time came around, and Trina finally had some company. Two men and three woman dragged enough chairs to one table and sat together. They talked quietly. Trina put her earbuds in but didn\u2019t play anything, and eventually they got louder.\u00a0\n\u201cThere by seven o\u2019clock, no later,\u201d the shorter man was saying. \u201cCassie said his routine is the same every night. He doesn\u2019t suspect a thing.\u201d\u00a0\nThe group didn\u2019t stay very long, and Trina left behind them. She followed them at a distance. Gary was left to watch the restaurant.\nTrina watched the cars pull up quietly beside the road, and she drove past and parked a block away before sneaking back on foot. Whispers met her ears as she rounded the neighbouring house and peeked over the bushes.\u00a0\nThen they started to sing. She poked her head out further and saw the whole group from the restaurant, as well as others she had never seen before. They were singing a hymn! An old man came to the door and smiled and started crying.\nTrina shook her head, annoyed, and tiptoed around the back of the house. Everything looked fine in the backyard; no one else was sneaking around. Then her phone rang.\u00a0\nShe fumbled for it\u2014Gary was calling\u2014and shut it off, but not soon enough. The singing halted. She bolted. A few people followed her, and she dashed through a few backyards and leaped a couple fences before scaling a tree. Her pursuers abandoned the search while she texted Gary.\u00a0\nApparently, a van had pulled up to Sue\u2019s place. The girl had been escorted inside, and he was following them.\u00a0\nShe let herself down from the tree and ran for her car. She recognized Gary\u2019s car as the van in front of him pulled into a nice-looking house.\u00a0\nA middle-aged man and women got out of the van first. Then the skinny girl stepped out, but she was no longer shaking. She was wearing enough clothes now, and her hair was shiny and smooth in the porch light. Trina saw her give the couple a little smile as they invited her inside.\u00a0\nShe drove back slowly, planning on driving past the restaurant, but the lights were still on. She parked and went inside, planning to pretend she had lost something and was looking for it here.\u00a0\nThe sound that greeted her was like an \u201cOh!\u201d and her eyes adjusted in time to see Sue straightening up from the same place the raggedy boys had been sweeping.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Trina demanded. Her good, unassuming hoodie was dirty and had a tear in the sleeve, and her perfectly normal auburn hair had leaves in it, and nothing had gone right all day.\nThe little old lady smiled sweetly and asked if she had come back for more coffee.\u00a0\nThe honest answer was yes, but Trina lied and said no. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nSue wrung her hands on her stained apron, but the pocket jingled, and Trina pushed past her and knelt to the floor. She pried up the loose board to find a collection of coins.\n\u201cWhere did this come from? Do those boys get it for you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d The little old lady transformed into a terrifying spectre, frowning and shaking her finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell a soul. It's for their sister.\u201d\n\u201cWhere do they get it from? Are they stealing?\u201d\n\u201cGoodness, no! They work odd jobs for people, and some money they find in the street.\u201d\n\u201cSo they keep it here, and you get your cut?\u201d\n\u201cYoung lady, you are on my premises without a search warrant. I suggest you leave.\u201d\nTrina huffed. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Your food is terrible. Your cleanup crew are raggedy little urchins. Your employees are skinny street girls that get smuggled away. Your only customers are a couple of church people that don't look like church people. How are you still in business?\u201d\nThe little old lady shook her head. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come here for the food; so please, if you don\u2019t want coffee, I want to head to bed.\u201d\nThe failed detective headed out the door and sat in her car. Through the streaky windows, she watched Sue get back down on the floor, pry up the board, and empty her apron pocket into it.\u00a0\nSince Trina had blown her cover, Gary watched the restaurant alone for a few more days. The raggedy boys came back almost every day. One day, they seemed more excited than usual, and he followed them to a mall. They picked out a pretty blue dress and disappeared down an alleyway.\nSue\u2019s place continued to operate for another ten years, but then the little old lady died. A retired detective bought the restaurant. She kept the name and the quality of cooking\u2014the food was truly atrocious\u2014but she made good coffee.\u00a0"}
{"title": "Darker Lipstick ( 1st book in series)", "story": "If I rub my ruffled fingertips into the lining of my jacket one more time, the bartender will continue to make that face. That face that will expresses a lightning bolt of discomfort. His lips squirming with pre paid insults about me that only live in his head. Those awful slights would expand outwardly and grow fungus in the ears of his co-workers. But That would happen on my departure, he sadly would have to wait.\nTapping my glass seemed pompous so I tried to say my drink order out loud . This part was a struggle for me, and clearly wasn\u2019t received correctly by the well dress bartender. Rolling his eyes and walking away, he re-filled my drink with the last one I had. I wanted something different , But the punishment was warranted for the performance I gave. The worst part of this transaction was a subtle tap on my shoulder after he walked past my table. The tap was drenched in pity. It was a custom built shoulder contact gesture. A tap for an older single man sitting at a large community table at in a bar grading papers. His finger tips were also in better shape than mine which sent me into a physical slump.\nI missed my office! My office and the silence it gave me. The college I\u2019m a professor at was in an up roar over a scandal. Take your pick of classic horror stories you hear about teacher / student interactions. If you picked the one that Involves sexual relations? You would be spot on. Three of my fellow coworkers  were discovered having inappropriate relationships with students. The details were foggy but the sentences were now set in stone. This week was the settling of the dust if you will. Our offices will open up tomorrow morning and this nightmare of working at this bar would be over.\n I can almost hear your thoughts!\n Why not just work out of my own home!? It was a sensory thing. I needed to be silent, as well as seeing people moving about. As a failed writer and now a newly crowned English lit professor. I found this was my execution process. And what soon to be settling old man doesn\u2019t love a good process. But now it\u2019s been reduced to an oak barrel scotch drink and a bartender that looks at my life as a fall risk. Ugh! My sigh came out like an obnoxious over due bill. Moving my eyes over my papers, the bar atmosphere twirled around me like a straw to a mouth. College jackets on every chair back. Chicken fingers and hair gel smells were slowing my attention span. I was almost done, and my night would end in a similar good vibe theme. Vitamins and a sleep mask would be my lover tonight.\nDo you know what really bothered me? Every professor was interrogated. I was somewhat in the middle of the pack regarding the order of the interrogations. I watched the hallways cover themselves with gossip and rumors. Crying eyes from grown men and stress raking at even the ones that were innocent. Either clean or guilty, the space we called our job was now an oven with teeth. Either you knew someone who did it, or you were the one. Everybody was at fault, So it would seem.\nWhen it became my turn I walked into the designated room and sat down ready to give them whatever they needed.\n Granted I didn\u2019t know anything or would ever do anything like that! I just wanted to cooperate\u2026.I wanted to be apart of something.\n The average time for these particular meetings were about running two hours long. My meeting was less then three minutes! I was dismissed early due to my lack of social involvement. That was thee official statement they gave me. Not only was I not accused or mention by a student. But my co- workers didn\u2019t mention me either. I wasn\u2019t mentioned in any way, not even as a point of reference. I\u2019ve been at this school for 5 years and I didn\u2019t have a single friend in this building. My students knew me as just a person in front of them. And my peers just viewed me as small talk target practice. The administration thanked me for being a professional and a gentleman. I even got a promotion due to the vacancy the three convicted professors. I was excused from the room with a since of some sort of a positive notion. And then they would shake my hand and give me a shoulder pat.\nI was slightly offended. And I know how gross that sounds in hindsight. But I think I was just non aware of how much of a ghost I\u2019ve become. Snapping out my thoughts I began working on the last paper. The bar was crowded but not to point where someone needed to sit next to me. \nSo when someone did, I was startled a bit. I shuffled my seat away and never lifted my head up. I can feel my self getting clammy, but my discipline as an educator was at a very high level. It was a skill I didn\u2019t know I had until I quit trying be a writer. Chasing a dream talent just to find my submissive talent. I rarely break my focus, but then I heard her voice! \u201cDo you want some\u201d that was the question she asked me. So I had to look up! I couldn\u2019t ignore a voice like that. \u201cDo you want some\u201d she asked again. I looked up and saw a basket of chicken fingers and knew she was referring to this freind peace greeting . And then I looked at her! Her hair was cut short with round bangs that moved like barley in a field. Peach pale skin and with oval shaped eyes. Her outfit was amazing and simple. A Plaid skirt with a quote for a tattoo, on her right thigh. Hells and a funny T- shirt with a sweater. I saw her lips curl to ask for a third time, and I didn\u2019t want that. So I cut her off by saying yes! My smile was almost unbearable to hold. My body felt like it was waving. This had to be one of the most beautiful people I\u2019ve ever seen. While this high tension of pure silence was happening. A kid that clearly went to school here, ran into our table. We both reacted the same way, Me and this mystery being. Our faces were in pure symmetry over this act. Our eyes rolled and we blew our breathe. My thoughts were drenched and how stupid the youth could be at times. And when I looked back at her face, I could tell she was sprinkled with the same feeling.\nIan was my name, and Erin was her name. It was the first time all week I told someone what my name was. Maybe even all month.\n We talked for hours, It only seemed liked minutes. The bartender who was now my biggest fan, was giving me winks and ok symbols. He Began to lock up and usher people out of the door. \u201cWalk me Home\u201d Erin said this as a question but it was delivered in a whisper. That question was one I would gladly say yes to a hundred times over. We were arm and elbow intertwined and the chemistry that was sprouting out of our chest, was disturbing my heart beats. The kind bouncer, Although terrible at his job, Said mam to Her on the way out and Erin laughed relentlessly. Without warning The walk to Erins house was re routed to my apartment. She said something about her roommate being up. A temporary Roomate said she that was only in town for a week. A tiny bit weird, but I got passed it. So we went to my apartment. When she walked inside my door she yelled the word fancy! It was a bit obnoxious but in the way of like saying the word surprise! I was tickled by her humor and comfort. She slipped out of her heels and began to study the paintings on my wall. We talked about this he same things on opposite couches . It felt good to be on the cloud 9 for once. I was flirting incredibly and I could feel it coming back to me like a receipt . At one point she said she had a crush on me!? I was confused because I don\u2019t know if we ever met Erin before. But I didn\u2019t question it, so we moved on.\nher and I danced to my playlist that had a mix of 90s and current music and classical abrasions of jazz. She was Almost familiar with every song. We had so much in common and holding her felt like running in a pool. Weightless and glowing She asked me if she could sleep here!? I told her she could have my bed and I would sleep on the couch. Erin put here arms on my neck and simply shook her head no! Meaning I didn\u2019t have to be away from her. She wanted to go to the bathroom first, so I sat in my chair. A chair I\u2019ve sat in so many nights alone. Dis- attached and alone, and for the first time in a long time I felt apart. I was so into this moment that my thoughts were distant cousins. I didn\u2019t think about anything because I didn\u2019t need to. Right now me and this beautiful woman where about to \u2026 wait?\nI never asked if she was..\nHey\u201d Erin said as she came out of the bathroom with a giant smile. Hey! I said back with a nervous posture . She asked me if the thing on my kitchen table was an air fryer? Yes I said. Her eyes started to sparkle. I\u2019ve never used one before.\n\u201cCan you teach me professor\u201d\nthe end."}

The other half were slapping thighs and rocking back in laughter - I was one of the ones rocking back and forth. \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n \n\u201cI stand here on this most precious of moments and share with you the story of our eternal love and gratefulness of our family. We welcome Henry, dear Henry\u2026\u201d\nThe entire room of gathered friends and family yelled in unison \u201cDEAR HENRY, DEAR HENRY!\u201d Cheers roared out, tables were banged, and glasses clinked.\nAs the ruckus dimmed, the father of the bride continued.\n\u201cYou all know me, and you all know I hate this standing round talking, so I think this is the perfect time to hand over to the real spokesperson of the family. Darling\u2026would you like to continue?\u201d\nShe sat for a minute, tears spilling over her lids and composed herself as she moved her napkin from her lap to the table.\n\u201cIt was my dad, the best pop in the world, that came to us the day you were born, carrying a red pine seedling with your name and date of birth embroidered in the pink ribbon wrapped around it. We weren't sure what we were to do with the gift. I knew they grew into the most beautiful giants of trees.\u201d\n\"It's for her future. It's the tree that will keep on giving.\"\nHis voice had been soft and sincere, and his eyes had been full of love.\n He had told me. \nI asked him about the seedling, and he said he had gone to the nursery on the day we told him we would soon be calling him pop. He browsed the trees for hours until he picked the right one, the perfect one to put your name to.\nAs you grew, so did the tree. As you learnt to walk, your tree learned to sway with the wind, and true to his word you both grew and reached for the stars.\nNan made picnics for you to have under the evergreen growing branches of your tree. and when you were 6 and your tree was good and sturdy, pop hung a swing to push you in for hours.\nAnd when Nan bought you a leather-bound journal at 13 years old, you would go and sit under that tree and write your hopes and dreams in the shade of its branches.\nSometimes we would see you just sitting under the tree at 16, just being there. \nAnd as you grew further and met the man you would marry, he knew the importance of that tree and proposed with moonlight shining through the leaves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you have visited your tree and although the memories will always remain, pop had one thing in mind when he bought that tree the day he found out you would be coming into this world, and that was to give you a wedding gift.\nYou will cry tears of sadness and tears of happiness, dad would you like to do the honours?\u201d\nThe sturdy old man stood tall. Feet planted shoulder width apart as if he himself were a giant of the forest. The smile he shared with his daughter as she kissed him on the cheek melted every heart in the room. \n\u201cI love you dad.\u201d She whispered into his ear.\nHe turned to the bride\n\"My darling granddaughter, behind you, you see the all the pictures on the screen of you and your tree and all the joy and happiness you brought to not only your Mum and Dad, but to Nan and I, always. Your tree was no longer able to protect you from the bright sun or give you cover from wind and rain in the form it had grown. Your tree is your ever evolving and everlasting gift from us to you.\"\nHe handed her a set of keys.\n\"It almost shattered my heart to say goodbye to your beautiful protector, but soon you will have your own precious child and that child deserves his or her own tree. Turn to the screen our darling granddaughter, and mind not to ruin your makeup.\u201d His eyes glistened and he lowered his head.\nShe turned to the screen and saw a beautiful timber house. She looked at the keys and then at the house.\n\"A house? We can't accept a house!\"\n\"Look at the background.\" She looked at the background on the oversized screen. The house was exactly where her tree had stood.\n\"Grandpa! Is that my tree! You turned my tree into a house!\"\nTears streamed down her face.\n\u201cAnd in the backyard, I shall plant another for your child to be, and it shall be nurtured as your tree was. It shall bring endless fond memories for all the family, and you shall be forever protected in your tree house.\"\nThe old man raised a glass.\n\"A toast to the bride and groom. May they always feel safe and secure and grow stronger together each day.\u201d\n\u201cTo the bride and groom!\u201d\nGlasses clinked and cheers roared out while tears were dried on napkins and sleeves and the bride and groom hugged her grandparents tightly.\nNan was clapping like a cymbal-banging monkey and jumping up and down uncoordinatedly\u2026until she stopped dead in her tracks.\n\"Oh shoot!\" Nan said to the bride.\n\"You darn went and squeezed me too tight!

{"title": "A Tete-a-Tete With A Librarian", "story": "A series of hanging lights lit the library. The hall was otherwise silent, except for the occasional tapping of a keyboard or the whirring of a printer. A faint murmur could be heard. \"Shhh,\" said the librarian and the silence was restored. \n \nA young man donning a cap that covered almost half of his face entered the library. He walked to the corner table and saw that it was occupied. With fumes emanating from his nose and ears, he walked to the librarian and demanded, \"The corner table is occupied. It's mine. Ask that woman to leave.\"\n \nThe librarian lifted her head that was buried in a book. She adjusted her spectacles and looked at the young man. She smiled leaving him flustered. \"Son, this library is open for all\u00a0The tables here are occupied on a first come first serve basis. Why don't you choose some other table,\" she suggested.\n \nHe stomped his feet and twitched his nose. \"Lady, don't give me instructions. I hate change,\" he clenched his fist as he spoke.\nShe looked at him for a few seconds and began to walk away without uttering a word. \n \n\"You can't leave,\" he banged the table with his fist. She shushed him and left. After a few minutes, she returned with a book in her hand. \"Who Moved My Cheese\" read the title. \n\"Read this book. It will help in changing your mindset,\" she said. He snorted in disgust. \n \nIgnoring his misdemeanour she continued with whatever she was doing. He walked out of the library. He walked to a narrow alley and lit a cigarette. The smoke he exhaled swirled in the air. He flipped the pages of the book reluctantly. The quote \"Life moves on and so should we\" made him stop. He drew another puff and reflected on the series of events that had just transpired. The book suggestion made by the librarian coerced him to contemplate his mindset. \n \nHer choice of book was spot on. That was it. She was the person with whom he must talk. He could not go on with the current frame of mind and he knew it. He dropped the cigarette to the ground and crushed it with his foot, leaving a black mark on the ground.\n \nHe walked back to the library. He noticed that the librarian was standing on a ladder and was arranging books on the topmost shelf. Tapping on the table continuously, he waited for her. After twenty minutes, she returned. She looked at him and raised her eyebrows into a question mark. \n \n\"How can I help you?\" She asked.\n\"I want to have a little chat with you,\" he replied.\n\"Regarding?\" she asked.\n\"It's a little private,\" he said.\n\"I'm not your counsellor son,\" she said.\nHe felt offended but shoving his feelings under the rug he said, \"Come on, sparing thirty minutes for a discussion will not kill you. Will it?\"\nThe woman's lips parted into a quick smile but she concealed it with a grim expression.\nShe looked at her calendar and said, \"Twenty minutes is all you have.\" He agreed. They walked to the coffee machine located in the corner of the library and filled their cups with coffee.\nHe stood hesitating. \"The clock is ticking young man. I don't have all day,\" she said.\n \n\"My mom had left this world when I was a child. After a lot of struggle, I had made peace with the fact. My father married a woman from his office. It was a bolt from the blue for me. I had difficulty adjusting to my stepmom. She was a kind woman but her presence suffocated me. I cribbed and cried to garner my father's attention. He enrolled me in a boarding school. It was the second major change I had to accept within a year. I gradually made friends. All good things come to an end and so did my schooling,\" he spoke.\n \nShe looked at him empathetically. \"I attended college and bagged a job with a fat paycheck. I had no personal life. I dedicated my life to the firm. Everything was rosy, until one day, the firm was taken over by another management. I have been on a downhill since then. The change of management didn't go well with me. There was a cut in my paycheck and it wasn't of good taste. Cigarettes and alcohol gave me company. It was when I met a girl in a bar. We indulged in a little chat and one thing led to the other. A series of one nightstands paved the way to a relationship. Her presence in my life became suffocating. I was used to being alone and I didn't like her interference. But I liked her and didn't want to break up. Before I could figure things out she suggested that we must move in together. Another change was unacceptable. It was driving me crazy. I walked to the library in quest of some solace but my table was occupied and I lost it,\" he concluded.\n \nShe couldn't help but smile at him. \"So you want me to help you solve your so-called problems, isn't it?\" She asked. \n\"I could use some help,\" he replied.\n\"It's all in your mind son. As Heraclitus quoted, Change is the only constant. You must embrace it. Change can be good at times. Focus on the brighter side. Change your perspective. Read the book Who moved my cheese. Spencer Jhonson used cheese, as a metaphor to explain how to deal with unexpected change. It's a fable about four characters who live in a maze and they love cheese. But one day, the cheese disappears. Read the book and find out how they dealt with it and who emerged successfully. Nothing is permanent except change. Learn to adapt lest you will rot in a rabbit hole,\" she spoke.\n \nThe young man appeared to be relaxed. He clasped the book tightly. He nodded and smiled partially. \n\"Thanks for your time. I will get back to you after a week,\" he said.\n\"Don't make this a habit,\" she said and walked away.\n \nA week passed. The young man walked in and searched for the librarian. She wasn't there. A young lady asked, \"May I help you?\" \n\"I'm looking for the librarian,\" he said.\n\"I'm the librarian,\" she said.\n\"What about the elderly woman who was here the previous week?\" He asked.\n \n\"Oh, she was here only for a month. I was on a vacation and she was here to fill in for me,\" she said.\nHe remembered her words, \"Don't make this a habit.\"\nHe smiled and thought,' The book and her pearls of wisdom helped. Another change and all I can do is accept.' \n \nHe thanked the young girl and walked away. He wasn't adept at accepting change yet. But he was trying. One day at a time.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "The Sleeping Beauty Sleep Solution", "story": "It\u2019s that fuzzy, foggy time of the day that falls somewhere between awareness and sleep. Not awake, not asleep, somewhere in between. If you catch it just right, words and sounds enter your ears while awake, and are received in the recesses of the mind when asleep. This often results in muddled messaging, a wandering, creative maze of interpretations. It is the stuff dreams are made of.\nEight year old Sarah and her mom had been abandoned by Sarah\u2019s father years ago. He left them with nothing. Sarah\u2019s mom, Marcia, heartbroken and destitute, worked as many hours as she could, but it was always a struggle. They had each other, and usually that was enough. On days when their mutual support seemed to fall short, Sarah would keep their ship afloat by singing to her Mother, the lyrics \u201cFairy Tales Can Come True\u201d being the go-to tune. They would tell each other, only half jokingly, that a modern day Prince Charming would someday show up and rescue them from their dismal economic circumstances while at the same time mending Marcia\u2019s broken heart and giving Sarah a good dad. All the wishing and dreaming had brought nothing.\nEvery night, Marcia would tuck Sarah in bed and read a bedtime story to her. Fairy tales were the favorite as they allowed for thinking, seeing, dreaming, outside their present circumstance. Marcia never missed a night, and it was unlikely that Sarah could ever attain sleep without the routine. The only problem was that Marcia\u2019s voice was so loving, so soothing, that Sarah would almost always fall asleep early in the story. Sarah would then create her own ending in her dreams. Marcia would hear Sarah\u2019s version, actually her recollection, of the end of the story at breakfast the next morning. The dream endings were always better than the original, save one.\nMarcia sat on the old rocking chair next to Sarah\u2019s bed. Stacks of children\u2019s books were piled high on the small table next to her.\n\u201cWhat will it be tonight, sweetheart?\u201d\n\u201cHow about \u2018Little Red Riding Hood\u2019, Mother? We haven\u2019t had that one for quite some time.\u201d\nSarah was a precocious child, and her tone and word choice were always above her age.\n\u201cSounds good.\u201d\nSarah was drifting in and out of consciousness at about the time the wolf met Little Red Riding Hood in the woods.\n\u201cWhat have you got in your apron?\u201d\nMarcia loved reading the stories as much as Sarah liked hearing them. Her voice would change with the character, and Sarah enjoyed her mother speaking in a gruff voice that any self-respecting wolf would be proud of.\n\u201cCake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\u201d\n\u201cWhere does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\u201d\nSarah was sound asleep even before the wolf hatched his evil plan. Marcia left the room wondering just how the story would end this time. As usual, she got the full report the next morning at breakfast.\n\u201cMother, when Little Red Riding Hood met the wolf in the woods, she got angry, I mean really angry. She told the wolf that she knew what he was up to, and that if he kept going around eating people, someone would come after him and shoot him. Little Red Riding Hood was so tough, mother! You should have seen it!\u00a0So they made an agreement.\u201d\n\u201cReally? And what was the agreement?\u201d\n\u201cLittle Red Riding Hood told the wolf that if he stopped eating people, every time she would take cake and wine to her grandmother, he could have a big piece of cake and a glass of wine. The wolf said they had a deal if every once in awhile it would be chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. Little Red Riding Hood agreed, they shook on it, and everyone lived happily ever after.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very nice ending.\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\nAnd so it went. Sometimes Sarah had some basic, childlike, perhaps even predictable, endings- Humpty Dumpty\u2019s mother saw him trying to climb up on top of that wall and stopped him before he ever had a chance to fall. But she also came up with some rather imaginative conclusions that you would not expect from an eight year old. Marcia wasn\u2019t sure how Sarah came up with these stories, but she enjoyed them thoroughly.\nAccording to Sarah, Hansel and Gretel convinced the old woman she didn\u2019t need to be eating children by hooking her up with the people at Meals on Wheels. The Three Little Pigs managed to persuade the Big Bad Wolf that he was Jewish and couldn\u2019t eat pork. The Giant quickly changed his tune when Jack told him he could make a lot of money playing basketball if he were to enroll in an anger management program. Everyone, good\u00a0guys and bad guys alike, faired so much better in the morning than they did the previous evening. Well, almost everyone.\n\u201cWhat would you like to hear tonight, sweetheart?\u201d\nThe response was slower that usual.\n\u201cHow about the story of Sleeping Beauty?\u201d\nAnother slower than usual response.\n\u201cOh, sweetheart, are you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Mother. I want to try again.\u201d\nWith some hesitation, Marcia picked up the book. She had barely started to read when Sarah\u2019s eyes began to flicker open and closed.\n\u201cBut scarcely had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it. And in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.\u201d\nThere was little optimism or enthusiasm at the breakfast table the next morning. Sarah\u2019s expression spoke only sadness.\n\u201cThe prince never showed up\u2026again. I\u2019m sorry, Mother.\u201d\nMarcia did her best to conceal her own disappointment. You see, she too had become affected by the hopes and dreams told in fairy tales.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You have nothing to be sorry about. It\u2019s only a dream.\u201d\nOnly a dream. The problem was that Marcia had inserted herself into that dream. Hope, dream, fantasize, happy ending. If only life was as simple and happy as a fairy tale.\nThe routine went on and on and on. The beginning of a fairy tale at night with a new, improved ending in the morning, except for that darn prince who never showed up. Losing hope doesn\u2019t happen at one particular moment. Hope is taken bit by bit, piece by piece, over time, until there is none. Marcia didn\u2019t have many bits and pieces left for the taking.\nThe story telling continued for many months- a little girl and three bears, tuffets, trolls under bridges, lost sheep, pumpkins turning into carriages, peas under mattresses, and all things make believe, except for the girl waiting for the kiss that would give her life. For the sake of avoiding further disappointment, they finally decided to give the story of Sleeping Beauty a rest.\nLife trudged on for Marcia, working two jobs, caring for a child, cooking, cleaning, dealing with the crushing anxiety of financial stress. It was a harder row to hoe without the tailwind of a hopeful, positive attitude. Marcia had pretty well given up on anything magical in her future.\u00a0But she still had those happy moments reading to her little girl at night and listening to the replay the next morning.\n\u201cWhat would you like to hear tonight, sweetheart?\u201d\nThere was no answer.\n\u201cSweetheart? What story would you like me to read?\u201d\nSarah slowly raised her eyes and replied, \u201cThe story of Sleeping Beauty\u201d.\n\u201cOh, sweetheart. I thought we gave up on that a long time ago. It never comes out right.\u201d\nNow the voice was stern, serious.\n\u201cThe story of Sleeping Beauty.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cMother, I don\u2019t know why, but I feel something. I feel like there will be a different ending tonight. Please, Mother. Read the story of Sleeping Beauty to me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, sweetheart.\u201d\nIt took Marcia a couple of minutes to find the previously banished book.\n\u201cAnd in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.\u201d\u00a0\nSarah conked out right on cue.\nMaybe Marcia was just too tired to get up. Maybe she only wanted to watch her daughter for a little while longer before yet another disappointing dream stole her spirit. Or maybe, just maybe, she wanted to study the face of her sleeping child as a dream might carry her off to a happy place. Marcia slowly got up, put the book on the table, and took one more look at her daughter. She thought she detected the hint of a smile.\nMarcia was in the kitchen scrambling a few eggs when she heard Sarah\u2019 shrieking voice and her footsteps as she flew down the stairs.\n\u201cMother! Mother! He showed up! The Prince showed up! I knew he would!\u201d\nSarah bolted into the kitchen as Marcia stood in a near state of shock.\n\u201cHe walked right over to Sleeping Beauty, and he kissed her! He kissed her, Mother! And Sleeping Beauty got right up! I saw the whole thing!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, sweetheart. I can hardly believe it!\u201d\nSarah calmed down just a little.\n\u201cAnd, mother, when Sleeping Beauty got up, I could see her face for the first time. Mother, Sleeping Beauty was you.\u201d\nIt might have been seeing her daughter so happy, or was it the hint of hope being rekindled? One or the other, or both, could claim credit for the tears welling up in Marcia\u2019s eyes.\nMarcia and Sarah smiled, laughed, and hugged. They took each other\u2019s hands and danced around the kitchen until\u2026\nThe doorbell rang.\nMarcia and Sarah stared at each other.\n\u201cYou better get that, Mother. It might be him.\u201d\nMarcia laughed.\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nMother and daughter walked to the front door. Marcia opened the door to see a nice looking man, about her age, standing on the porch. Sarah\u2019s smile was beyond description.\n\u201cHello. I\u2019m Jack Larson. My son and I are moving in just down the street, and we thought we should introduce ourselves to some of our new neighbors. It was actually my son Charlie\u2019s idea. He wanted to see if there were any kids in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\u201cHi, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Marcia Bennet, and this is my daughter Sarah. It\u2019s just the two of us here.\u201d\nJack turned to his side and pulled Charlie, looking to be about five or six years old, toward the doorway. When Charlie saw Marcia, his eyes lit up, and he threw his finger at her like a dart.\n\u201cThere she is! Dad! It\u2019s her! I told you! It\u2019s the Fairy Princess! I knew it! I just knew it! I told you that you would meet her, and there she is!\u201d\nA very embarrassed Jack tried to quiet his excited child, and then turned back to Marcia and Sarah.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. After he lost his mother a couple of years ago, Charlie keeps talking about how a pretty lady will show up someday to take care of us. In fact\u2026he told me just this morning that he dreamed last night I would be meeting a Fairy Princess. That\u2019s what that was all about.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2026that is pretty amazing.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know, he has a wild imagination.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not that. The amazing thing is my daughter had the same dream last night, well, that I was a Fairy Princess and would soon be rescued by a Prince.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d\nSarah\u2019s smile was frozen in place.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not kidding.\u201d\nA few moments of silence followed as neither Marcia nor Jack knew quite what to say.\n\u201cSay, you look a little familiar. I wonder if our kids go to the same school. Charlie\u2019s in the first grade at Jefferson.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Sarah goes to Jefferson. She\u2019s in the third grade. Sarah, have you ever seen Charlie around school?\u201d\n\u201cNo, mother, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\nJack and Marcia looked at one another. It wasn\u2019t the normal look you\u2019d expect from people who had just met. It was the look of two people stunned by coincidence and captured by fate.\n\u201cListen, I may not be a Fairy Princess, but I make a pretty good cup of coffee. Would you like to come in.\u201d?\n\u201cYes, yes I would.\u201d\n\u201cSarah, why don\u2019t you take Charlie outside and show him the tire swing? We\u2019ll be in the kitchen.\u201d\nAs Marcia and Jack walked to the kitchen, Sarah turned toward Charlie who was grinning from ear to ear. Sarah smiled, gave him a quick wink, and spoke in a barely audible whisper.\n\u201cGood job, Charlie.\u201d"}

Beep. \n \nThe monotonous sound of the code scanner kissing the greasy bindings of the books lent to the public library readers was becoming tiresome. It echoed at least twenty times per minute, and as the hours passed and his body slowly began to writhe with fatigue, he could no longer perceive the repetitive play from any distance. \n \nHe usually came to work with an upbeat attitude, convinced that his time in the library was worthwhile. The beeping of the small machine was more motivating in the morning \u2013 he could hear the sound of a job well done, which meant that the books were not lost and could be browsed through by other people, who would appear again and again in the doorway to get the information they wanted. However, this idea was no longer satisfying at the end of the day. It was drowned out by the pain of an oncoming backache, blurred vision, and thoughts of a good dinner. There was an hour left in the shift. Then he was free to go home.\n \nAs if real life was happening everywhere but within these walls. \n \nThen the entrance door opened. A strange couple entered the library. A girl of exotic appearance \u2013 but what does exotic really mean, thought the young librarian \u2013 and a man whose wrinkled face revealed the years he might have already experienced while his girlfriend was still unborn.\n \nShe was fresh, full of life, announcing her arrival with a ringing laugh that naturally outraged the whole library. Shh! Echoed in one accord from behind the shelves and from the armchairs reserved for the quiet reading of dusty volumes by authors no longer alive. \n \nHe, too, was full of life, driven by the girl at his side, with body movements that showed he didn't care much for the opinions of others.\n \nWhile he watched these two in silence, he continued to receive the books heading back to the shelves. People returned last-minute borrowed copies \u2013 retirees using the books to help them get their lives back on track, students looking for guidance on life, or mothers trying to find ways to take care of their child's health and not ruin the life that had just started \u2013 all of them trying to steal his attention. But he kept an eye on that two.\n \n\"Don't fight it so much! Pick a book, open it to a random page, and read me what it says,\" the man encouraged the young girl. Still laughing, she stepped in front of one of the shelves in the novel section, reached behind her and pulled out a slim book, and began to read.\n \n \n\"I have been walking for more than a month. Soon I got calluses on my feet, but I didn't care. I was happy to leave my daily routine and embark on a new adventure,\" she began to read aloud.\n \nShe looked at her boyfriend. He was watching her with interest. But his eyes were focused on her lips, and her breasts moving with each breath she took. She whirled around and scanned the library space as if she suddenly realized the casualness of their entrance into the building and the noise that accompanied their arrival. She noticed a young librarian a few feet away from them, boringly scanning the books being returned by the crowd. Then she turned her gaze back.\n \n\"When I reached the border between Austria and Italy, my shoes were so worn out that I had to throw them in the trash. I continued on for several kilometers barefoot, but the rocky path was crushing my skin, so I rang the doorbell of the nearest house and asked the locals if they knew anyone who could give me new shoes.\"\n \nAs she kept reading, she wondered if her theater had convinced her boyfriend. She knew the library well and stopped deliberately in front of the travel journals. She knew that if she stretched her arm straight enough, she would pull out one of the books she had already read. She managed to pick out an author who had walked from Prague to Venice and who, between the lines, told of a place that no longer existed today because Venice had become a ghost town. It was exactly what she dreamed of when she walked every day to the tram stop that took her to work.\n \n\"Finally, I've reached my destination,\" she finished reading a quote from a favorite writer and looked at her boyfriend. \n \nHe was smiling. \n\"And now me,\" he said without commenting on what he had heard. He took the girl's hand and pulled her towards the poetry department. \n \n \nI'm so happy, he told himself as he passed the young man behind the desk, who examined him suspiciously. He didn't like that look, so he frowned at him. He clasped Eve's palm and headed towards the shelves filled with poetry.\n \n\"I like Novalis,\" he said while breaking the rule of random book selection he had introduced a moment ago. The girl sat down in one of the musty chairs, waiting for him to start reading.\n \n\"Before I start,\" he said. \"Did you know that Novalis wanted to die by thought?\" \n\"What?\" his beautiful girlfriend responded in confusion. She licked her lips nervously and looked around again. \n \n\"Really! He died awfully early, he didn't even live to be thirty. When he was twenty-two, he got engaged to a girl named Sophie. She was thirteen,\" he explained as he flipped through his favorite poems. He hadn't noticed how his girlfriend's mood had changed. She looked around again while doubts began to appear on her face. \n \nFull of enthusiasm, he continued: \n\"Well, this Sophie died when she was fifteen. Shortly before they were supposed to get married. Novalis, of course, was deeply moved and decided to end his life as well. But he believed that the heart, the soul, and the body were so interconnected that there was no need to commit suicide by hanging or cutting oneself. He believed it was possible to end life without violence and blood, so he concentrated hard on dying. He regularly visited the grave of his beloved and waited for the consistent solitude to bring the death of his body.\"\n \n\"No way,\" said Eve, who was being devoured by the chair, weakly.\n \n\"Oh, really. Of course, he failed. Not only did he survive, but he fell in love again. But then he died of tuberculosis.\" He licked his lips and began to read:\n \n\"I'm sailing there now,\nwhere the tribulation\nturns to pleasure.\nSoon the soul\nwill fly away\nand rest in love\nin its embrace.\"\n \n \nAnd a dizzying life\nripples through me.\nNow I'm just looking down from above\nI look up to you.\nBy the cairn\nthy glow has faded\nand the cool wreath\nhas overshadowed thy face.\n \nThe librarian had just turned off his computer and was ready to leave when he heard the familiar verses. He turned his head to the couple who had moved to the other side of the room and watched the man recite poems about the loss of love without pause.\n \nMeanwhile, the girl sitting in the chair had ceased her efforts to escape the sudden inner stirring which led her to the dangerous thought. Was she not herself the girl who might die before her partner? Aren't these verses a proof that no love can be strong enough when even a writer so famous who made history with poems about his deceased fianc\u00e9e was able to love again after all? The thought tormented her, stripping her of the haze of love with which she had entered the library.\n \nSuddenly she wished for nothing but to slip away quietly. I'd rather walk to Venice alone now, she thought. \n \nBut the man sitting across from her continued to read the agonizing verses. At last, he could share with the girl of his dreams the words that had guided him through his adolescence and based on which he had created his own fantasy of love.\u00a0\n \nThe librarian took the card off his neck and went to the cloakroom to get his coat. As he made his way out of the library door, he noticed the exotic girl standing a few feet away from him, holding her cell phone tightly in her hand. While he was considering approaching her, she raised her head and looked at him with eyes full of hope.\n \nShe smiled, but he remained standing. And then he turned his back on her and went to the nearest subway station. \n \nWe are all bound by our love of books, he thought. But life is elsewhere.\u00a0"}

Those moments when you\u2019re on the brink of existential discovery, because it\u2019s you and nature. It\u2019s you and the universe. It\u2019s just you\u2026\nzzzzzzzzzzz\nThen it\u2019s not.\nNo. That is not the sound of peaceful snoring as you sleep in the unencumbered natural habitat of humanity (which is the fancy way of saying outside). That is not a peaceful drifting of a person who has fallen asleep in their tent under the twinkly sky above them, as the trees whisper in a cocooning breeze, surrounding you in a natural blanket of woodland protection (the fancy way of saying camping).\nNo.\nEverything you thought about the tranquility of nature, the peacefulness that is just you and the great outdoors, it has all been shattered with this one incessant high-pitched humming.\nThe mosquito.\nThis sound, when turned on in the darkness of your tent, basks you into a squeal of high-pitched ringing, just flickering with an intermittent idea of what\u2019s out there, but never letting you fully see what\u2019s in front of you before it disappears back into the blackness. It is a dying florescent light of the wilderness.\nThe mosquito\u2019s call is not a call of the wild. It is a call \n the wild. And the wild is you.\nThe power that that sound evokes inside you, as you hear it whispering in your ear. There is no sound that will bring a person to the bases of their animalistic barbarism like the sound of the mosquito taunting you through the night.\nIf the mosquito was kinder (as far as a blood sucking fiend can be kind), it would take your blood while you\u2019re lying there, swaddled in your sleeping bag, your face a charcuterie board that\u2019s already out and awaiting its hungry guest. But that is not the nature of the mosquito.\nThe nature of a mosquito is savage.\nIt does not want a readily available appetizer, a quick snack for the taking. It does not want the charcuterie board. It wants a buffet. It will tango with death, allowing you to release yourself from your cage, before it feasts. It must humiliate you before getting what it seeks.\nzzzZZZ\nAt that singular high-pitched sound, a beast explodes from within you, bringing you to an alert position, crouched on all fours, your legs still entangled inside your sleeping bag (because you are in a tent and cannot stand and face the enemy. The one advantage you have as a human). This is your first error. It has brought you down a level. You are no longer a civilized human, standing tall and proud, able to squash your enemy from above. You are now in a more vulnerable position, fetal almost. You have been brought back to the helpless position you were put in before you knew how to fend for yourself.\nYou listen, trying to find the source of the sound, but the sound has dissipated. The only thing you can hear are the crickets outside, the soft movement of the leaves as the wind catches them, and your palpitating heart as it thrums in your chest. But there is no more \n-ing.\nThis is your next error.\nYou are lulled into a false sense of security, even though deep down you know it\u2019s still out there. You pause a moment longer, letting your eyes dart back and forth, pretending like you are the one hunting, instead of the other way around.\nYou see nothing. You hear nothing. You tell yourself that you probably got it when you hurled yourself from the pad below your sleeping bag, crushing it in the force of your leap, a flattened emblem below you (Yes, that is it). You must convince yourself of this lie, otherwise sleep will await you in perpetuity.\nYou lay back down on your sleeping pad, breathing in the fresh air that has filled your flapless tent. You look to the glimmering blur above you (because you have taken out your contacts, and the stars are just blobs in the sky. But you know what they represent). You are once again one with nature.\nBut nature is not one with you. Nature is still hungry.\nZzzzzzz\nLast time you had been completely caught off guard. This time you have left an arm free, ready to make a countermove. You were not foolish enough to believe yourself of your lies!\nYou flail, swatting your arm in the direction of the sound. You make contact. It is but a wisp of hair that meets your palm. You have grasped nothing of substance.\n____________________________________________ ZZZZZZZZZ\nIt is on your other side now. The side still entrapped. It knows. If it could feed on shame alone, it would have quenched its thirst.\nYou try to maneuver your free arm to the other side, but the angle is no good. The only way to defeat it would be to smack your own head, but you are not yet that desperate. No, not desperate enough to hit your own head, but a new possibility opens up to you. When desperation calls, you may have to answer it, but no one said it had to be face to face.\nYou know what it really wants is for you to leave your safety net. That is what it\u2019s been asking of you the whole time. That is the translation of the whisper. You have tuned into the frequency of the high-pitched noise like a dog to a whistle. Only you can understand that it\u2019s calling for you.\nYou unzip your sleeping bag, letting the air flow in, opening your skin to the outside.\nNature is calling. It has been calling. That is why you are here. In this tent. On this earth. You cannot defeat nature. You do not want to defeat nature. All you want is to be part of it, and it a part of you.\nYou know those moments in life that seem eternal but are really ephemeral. This is that moment. Nature is infinite, but you are fleeting. There is no discovering existentiality, because by its very nature you exist to die.\nZZZzzz\nIt has come for you.\nIts high-pitched wail fading ever so slightly as it moves from your ear to the exposed skin of your leg, finally getting what it has wanted this whole time. You breathe in, letting this moment of time wash over you, an eternal moment for yourself caught in an ephemeral second of time.\nYou feel the ever so slight tickle of its landing, the teaser to the constant irritation that is to come. The itch that is worth every second of this moment with nature.\nIt is time for nature to be part of you, as you are now part of it. It is the final error. And it is the mosquito's.\nSPLAT\nNobody can make you bleed your own blood. Except for a mosquito.\nThe thing about the infinity of nature is that it\u2019s part of the circle of life.

{"title": "All It'll Be", "story": "\tMy mom took me along to choose a kitten from among many kittens, and among this many kittens was a well-mannered, healthy young man in a tortoise-shell suit; a clear winner. I didn't choose that one on account of my being what my mom called \"contrary\". I instead chose an ugly little lady who - we were warned - had temporary digestive issues. When we got her home and called her Mugsy she #2'd all over the house and fled from us, hiding under the bed in my little brother's room for most of the first few days. To bond we bought stuffed things and string things and balls with bells. These toys collected dust in a corner of the living room as she instead chose to play by sneak-attacking our bare hands and feet with tiny claws and fangs. For armor we plundered our closets and came up with leather gloves and snow mittens. These were shredded useless within a week. Dad bought us all heavy duty gardening gloves which held up quite well against assault.\u00a0One Sunday, as Mom had the front door cracked, hollering at her best girlfriend Vickie and her labrador Bella, our little one snuck by her, streaked madly across the lawn and that was the last we saw her. \u00a0\u00a0I can't say why for certain, and neither could my folks, but I think she ran away because she couldn't hurt us anymore. After that I used my Mugsy gloves for picking up pine cones fallen in the yard. And after that I used those gloves for work in our two-row garden out back.\u00a0Which, there wasn\u2019t much to do back there but pick out dollar weed and straighten the soil into neat edges and guess at which invader had been nibbling at which of the plants.\u00a0I told Mom that I knew squirrels were getting into the garden.\u00a0She tried to assure me they have no interest in anything in that garden but though I\u2019d never seen one troubling a plant of ours, I found squirrels suspicious and I believed what I believed. \u00a0My mom let me select one flower, fruit or veggie from her seed catalog once a year, and that year I picked \"Blue Boy Bachelor's Button\". The catalog told me it would sprout in seven to fourteen short days, which was the crucial selling point for me. Each planting season\u2019s rite \u2013 worry and wait.\u00a0On the eighth day of undisturbed soil I despaired, for not once had my annual seeds become anything but seeds. The ninth morning I moped out our back door toward our quaint garden whereupon sat a white and orange tabby cat with its tail tucked into a hole in the ground; just where my Blue Boy Bachelor's Button was supposed to bloom. As I squatted beside her, she rubbed her face against my knee a few times and smiled deep into the backs of my eyes. I had said \"please, please, please, let me, let me get what I want...\" and - here. A Blue Boy she ain\u2019t, but a blessing among myriad blessings; the grand design at play through the failed years!\u00a0\n\tOne night my new love was basking gently by the fire as her fur warmed. She sneezed cutely and my mom and I smiled to each other. She sneezed again with a great jerk of the head, stunning herself. She sneezed again \u2013 abruptly and quite loudly; each of us started as if a heavy door had been slammed shut. Then this cat sneezed explosively a fourth time into the fireplace which scattered the room with ash and cinders.\u00a0Mom swaddled my infant brother in his burp-stained yellow blanket and bursting through the back door, laid him oblivious on the porch\u2019s loveseat.\u00a0Frozen and aghast, I stared as my dad was unskilled with the extinguisher, frantically blasting the sofa and carpet. I watched teary-eyed on the screened-in porch as Mom lugged my tabby by the nape of her neck across the back yard and into the woods, hastening back toward the house empty-handed and without regret.\u00a0As we cleaned up inside, I heard cracking limbs and I felt thuds of toppled trunks. Rushing gusts recalling the great summer storms of the 90's. I heard sirens. My dad ordered us to huddle in the downstairs bathroom for it was the only room with no windows. We held a brief and decisive family meeting.\u00a0Brave Father commandeered the truck.\u00a0Mom sat shotgun with my brother swaddled giggling and drooling in her arms.\u00a0I occupied the jump seat behind Dad, which was always my spot, thrillingly serving now as my Official Post.\u00a0A three-foot tall green metal tank laid in the bed. We bounced along a familiar access road a mile, a mile and a half - through my inch-cracked window, I hollered \"There!\". \u00a0My dad evacuated, disappearing into the dust cloud raised by the dually\u2019s sudden halt. I heard the truck's back shocks screak as he jumped up in the bed and opened the valve on the tank. \u00a0One of my big black pine cone bags hissed as it plumped with helium. With a festival-sized black balloon straying behind him, Dad army-crawled a hundred yards across the leaves and bark on his stealth mission to deweaponize my beloved yet violently allergic tabby cat. The gales blew his long hair straight flat back and his rosy jowls flubbered as he drew near his target. He wrangled the feline into something like a rear naked choke, holding its back to his belly as he tied the helium-filled garbage bag to her long and handsome tail. With the greatest of all her sneezes, achooing a crater in the dry forest floor, she propelled herself above the loblollies, above the grey geese, carried lovingly by our family\u2019s crafty zeppelin to a place easier on her sinuses, that's what I prayed for. My mom the next week took me along to choose a houseplant from among many houseplants and she held up a houseplant and she said to me, \"This is a houseplant and that's all it'll be.\""}
{"title": "Growing Up", "story": " - read the poster hanging above Mrs. Langer\u2019s second grade classroom.\u00a0Below the poster sat a small plant and \u2013 Sam\u2019s favorite \u2013 a hamster relaxing in a hamster house.\nSam was a member of Mrs. Langer\u2019s classroom, and every chance he had, he ran - as fast as he was allowed - to catch a glimpse of Mr. Hammy, the classroom hamster.\u00a0Last week, Sam had even bought Mr. Hammy a toy \u2013 a small green and white colored ball.\u00a0When Mr. Hammy was presented with the new toy, he squealed with joy, holding on to the ball with his tiny claws, chewing on the rubbery lining.\u00a0\nSam always delighted in seeing Mr. Hammy playing with the gifted ball, until one day, when Mr. Hammy no longer seemed interested in playing with it.\u00a0\n\u201cMrs. Langer?\u201d Sam wondered, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Mr. Hammy playing with my ball like he used to?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d explained Mrs. Langer, \u201cMr. Hammy is growing up.\u00a0And as you grow up, toys that you used to play with, you may put away and no longer play with.\u00a0Mr. Hammy is becoming a big, strong adult hamster.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Sam responded with disappointment.\nAfter school that day, Sam returned home and was greeted by his older brother and parents. His older brother, however, quickly retreated to his bedroom to do homework. Watching closely, Sam copied him by retreating to his own bedroom.\nToys were spread out all over the floor of his bedroom, toys that he loved and enjoyed playing with.\u00a0\n, he thought to himself, as he started to gather the toys, one by one, and place them in his toy chest.\u00a0Once the toys were all in the chest, Sam locked the chest and slumped on to his bed.\nSam thought to himself.\u00a0He didn\u2019t feel any better.\u00a0In fact, without his toys, he was rather bored.\u00a0Sam waited, as the hours slowly ticked by, until he could hear his older brother snoring in the adjacent room.\nTip-toeing into his brother\u2019s room, Sam grabbed his brother\u2019s backpack, and quickly retreated back to his own bedroom.\u00a0He then emptied the contents of the backpack onto the floor.\u00a0Papers, folders, and books tumbled out from the backpack.\u00a0\nGrabbing the book closest to him, Sam opened the book and began reading:\n\u201cOn Joseph\u2019s farm there were a total of 40 animals - a combination of pigs and chickens.\u00a0Joseph counted 100 legs in all.\u00a0How many pigs were there, and how many chickens were there?\u201d\u00a0\n, Sam thought to himself.\u00a0He grabbed another book and began reading:\n\u201cOne of the causes of world hunger is infrastructure instability.\u00a0Poor infrastructure makes it difficult \u2013 even impossible \u2013 to transport food to towns or remote villages that desperately need it.\u201d\nScratching his head, Sam opened yet another book:\n\u201cThe US national debt has reached levels not seen since World War II.\u00a0As of 2019, US debt has grown beyond 17 trillion dollars.\u201d\nYawning, Sam closed the book and crawled into bed.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, sleep did not come easy for Sam that night - he ruminated over all the things he had just read.\u00a0\nAs for 17 trillion dollars, Sam wasn\u2019t sure exactly how much that was, but was hopeful that perhaps the coins in his piggy bank would be able to cover that.\n.\u00a0Sam would rather have spent the night bringing out his toys and playing with them one more time, but, as Mrs. Langer said, in order to be a strong grown-up, you need to put away your toys and deal with grown-up issues.\u00a0While not feeling content, exhaustion eventually overtook Sam, and he slept through the night.\nThe next morning Sam grabbed the books he took from his older brother\u2019s room and transferred them to his own backpack.\u00a0He dragged the heavy backpack all the way to school, before letting the backpack fall off his shoulder in Mrs. Langer\u2019s classroom.\nIt was free-time, and one of Sam\u2019s best friends immediately approached him.\n\u201cTom and I are playing monster game!\u00a0Come join us!\u201d\nSam declined, taking out one of his newly possessed books from his backpack.\u00a0\u201cI need to work on solving these problems.\u201d\nThroughout the rest of the school day, Sam declined to join in on the fun and games with his classmates, and instead focused on the problems documented in the book.\u00a0But despite all the pondering and contemplation, head-scratching and struggling, Sam wasn\u2019t one inch closer to solving any of the problems.\nDefeated, Sam buried his head into the book.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Mrs. Langer.\n\u201cLast night I put away all of my toys, and I started reading my brother\u2019s books.\u00a0They're full of problems, and I don\u2019t know how to fix any of them.\u00a0I really just want to play with my toys and my friends, but I also want to grow up, like Mr. Hammy.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u00a0Well let\u2019s go see what Mr. Hammy is doing right now.\u201d\nSam and his teacher walked over to the hamster house and took a look.\u00a0While the green and white ball was still sitting by itself, Mr. Hammy was instead in a hamster wheel, squealing as he ran and made the wheel spin and spin.\u00a0\n\u201cI just placed the wheel in his house this morning, and he\u2019s already loving it,\u201d Mrs. Langer started. \u201cGrowing up doesn't mean you have to throw away all your toys and only focus on adult problems.\u00a0As you grow up, there may come a time where you no longer enjoy playing with a specific toy, but that doesn't mean you need to stop playing all together.\u201d\nSurprised, Sam asked Mrs. Langer, \u201cDoes that mean I can still play with my friends?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you can!\u00a0And you don\u2019t need to stop just because you\u2019re all grown up.\u201d"}
{"title": "Between The Lines", "story": "Marie had never painted before\u2014that was always John\u2019s job.\u00a0\nBut the house needed to be sold and according to the real estate agent, it needed to be painted. Marie wasn\u2019t mad at John for leaving the task to her; she was angry at him for dying. John had bought life insurance, but hadn\u2019t anticipated the medical bills. He fought until his last breath, but the fight left Marie without a husband, without resources, and without a home.\nA painting novice, Marie attacked the big rooms and hallways first. They were the easiest with most of the furniture gone. Next, feeling emboldened by her success, she painted the bathrooms and kitchen. Those were a bit more difficult as she had to navigate her way around cabinets, mirrors, and fixtures. After that, there was just one spot left, the six-inch wide door frame near the stairs that contained a vertical history of their only child, Lisa.\nWhen Marie and John bought the home, Lisa was still four months away from joining the family. John, always the idealist, was not like other new homebuyers. To him this house wasn\u2019t supposed to be a starter home. It was his forever home, and if there were any doubt, he put that to rest the first time he and Marie entered as new owners.\n\u201cThe next time I leave this home permanently, it\u2019s going to be in a wooden box.\u201d\nAt the time, the young couple laughed together at the thought. Death was for other people. John and Maria were going to live forever and they were going to live forever in their new home.\nStaring at the faded lines, Marie smiled softly as a tear ran down her cheek. She couldn\u2019t help but remember the happier times when she and John prepared a room for the bundle of joy to come. John surprised her by painting the baby\u2019s room light blue. John was sure the new addition would be a boy, talking endlessly to his friends, neighbors, and any poor store clerk he ran into about John Jr. and how his son was going to be the third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles.\u00a0\nJohn's certainty even convinced Marie. It wasn\u2019t until the mother-to-be was eight months pregnant that the expectant parents discussed a possible girl's name during a commercial break. Many years later when Lisa asked how they decided on her name, the couple sheepishly admitted it was the name of a character on the television show they were watching, a fact that elicited benign laughs every time it was shared.\nEven before little Lisa was born, John and Marie had picked the perfect spot to document her milestones, a tradition brought to the family by both parents. The small spot where Marie now stood was that magical place she was being forced to paint over, erasing the lines that had been so important for so many years.\u00a0\nMarie thought to herself. \nUnable to finish, Marie poured herself a glass of wine, pulled up a chair, faced the unpainted wall, and remembered.\nThe first line, the one closest to the floor, was probably the least accurate. Baby Lisa had smiled for the first time that day, and John and Marie wanted to commemorate the occasion. Holding her little girl upright, Marie did her best to keep Lisa\u2019s foot on the floor while John attempted to make the new mark. Lisa, thinking this was a game, kicked her legs over and over, all the while laughing and smiling. When John\u00a0finally finished the task, both he and Marie roared hysterically at the crooked line that looked more like the peaks and valleys of a mountain range than an accurate measurement of the little girls height. It was almost impossible for them to look at that jagged line through the years and not chuckle at the memory.\nThe line from Lisa\u2019s first day of school was also the first one Marie herself had drawn. Lisa stood ramrod straight, trying to make herself as tall as possible. Marie marked Lisa\u2019s growth while John captured the memory using his new digital camera. The photo was the last one Marie had removed before she started to paint. There wasn\u2019t much she had unpacked at her new apartment, but that keepsake was already mounted on the wall by the front door.\nA few lines further up was one labeled \u201cPaint Day.\u201d It was the only line not tied to a significant day for Lisa. When quizzed about the anomaly, Marie would explain that when the family first moved into the home, the walls were bland, off-white, and builder grade. However, Marie loved green and John loved Marie, so when they decided to spice the place up, green it was.\u00a0\nJohn knew how important the marks on the wall were, so he meticulously created a template, complete with the unusual first line that he intended to use to recreate the measurements exactly. When he finished painting, he pulled out the guide and replaced each line precisely where it had been before. Every time Marie saw them, her heart fluttered, remembering how much John loved her and Lisa.\u00a0\nTwo lines further up was the measurement from when Lisa graduated from middle school. It took a lot of convincing to get her to remove her cap before that line was drawn. Almost fourteen years since the first line, Lisa still tried to make herself as tall as possible. Every line had a unique story and a memory and Marie smiled as she reminisced. The thought of covering the markings was paralyzing so instead Marie just sat, staring in silence, until the doorbell rang.\u00a0\nLisa didn\u2019t wait for her mother to answer, walking in denying Marie the time to compose herself. She also didn\u2019t have to ask what was wrong as Lisa saw the paint and the lines.\u00a0\n\u201cMom, it\u2019s going to be ok,\u201d Lisa said, pulling up a chair next to her mother. \u201cYou have to paint. Dad would understand.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Marie responded, trying to wipe the tears from her eyes. \u201cBut I never thought this would happen\u2014this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. These lines are your life, the life you and I shared with dad. How can I erase them?\u201d\n\u201cMom these lines are just placeholders,\u201d Lisa said, standing up and positioning herself next to the wall.\n\u201cYou see this line?\" Lisa asked, pointing to one just a few feet high. \"It\u2019s about as high as my knee, the knee I hurt playing soccer.\" You and dad were there. You guys were always there, remember?\" Marie nodded her head.\n\"Not every kid had two parents, and the ones that did rarely had both parents at every game. But I did. You were there to comfort me that day while Dad was calling an ambulance.\"\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d Marie chuckled, \u201cIf I remember correctly, he yelled at the surgeon before they wheeled you back. He made up for it though. Your dad wrote the nicest card afterwards, apologizing for the outburst and thanking the doctor for fixing his baby.\u201d\n\"And how about this line?\" Lisa continued, pointing to a line about as high as her stomach. \u201cThis line is right at my belly button. Remember when I pierced it without your permission. You were so mad, but dad was calm, he brought the temperature down and we talked it out. I thought I was so clever when I asked you if you still loved me. Do you remember your answer?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Marie answered and smiled. \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019ll always love you, but I just don\u2019t like you very much right now.\u2019\u201d The response causing both women to laugh.\n\u201cAnd this line right up here,\u201d Lisa said, calling Marie's attention to the highest line on the wall, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the height of my smile\u2014the same smile that everyone says reminds them of Dad. I love when they say that. In a way it means he\u2019s never really gone. You see Mom, you can feel free to paint over those lines because they won\u2019t ever disappear. All of them are right here, in me. I am the memories and the stories. Those are just markings on a wall, the important things have always lived between the lines\"\n\u201cHow did you get so smart?\u201d Maria asked, standing up and hugging her daughter.\n\u201cI learned from the best mom ever.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you think of my paint job? Is it up to dad\u2019s standards?\u201d\n\u201cDad would be proud,\u201d Lisa replied, giving her mom two thumbs up.\n\u201cHe was sure proud of you,\u201d Marie said, smiling. \u201cHe loved this house and we loved this record of your life, but you're right. You are our legacy, you are the yardstick of our lives. Now do me a favor and stand against this wall.\u201d\nLisa didn\u2019t hesitate for a second, standing ramrod straight while her mother marked one last line and the date.\nThen, with a smile as broad as her paint roller, Marie covered over the lines, realizing she hadn\u2019t erased them\u2014she had finished them."}
{"title": "Grow Up", "story": "Grow up.\u00a0\u201cGrow up!\u201d I yelled.\u00a0I was tired of waiting for the little seeds to burst through the earth.\u00a0If it takes this long for a seedling to pop up, how long will it take to produce something to eat?\u00a0Mom came outside and told me to be patient and they will grow.\u00a0It takes time, patience, and a lot of love for vegetables to grow from a seed.\u00a0I told mom that it\u2019s hard to be patient at 8 years old.\u00a0She laughed and said, \u201cJohnny, the seeds will grow as long as you continue to take care of them.\u00a0Just be patient.\u201d\nMy mom was a waitress and lost her job due to a nasty virus that was going around.\u00a0The restaurant completely shut down and the owner had no idea of when he would be opening back up.\u00a0Dad was receiving a small unemployment check because his job shut down, too.\u00a0Schools had also been closed, so I was missing the hot lunches from the lunch lady really bad.\u00a0We had become \u201cpoor\u201d within just a few months of the virus coming to town.\u00a0\nI overheard mom and dad talking about the bills and the college fund account they had started for me when I was born.\u00a0They had enough in the college fund to pay the house, car, and insurance payments\u00a0for about 6 months.\u00a0Dad\u2019s unemployment check could cover the utilities but there wasn\u2019t enough left over to buy groceries since mom wasn\u2019t receiving an unemployment check yet.\u00a0They were also discussing the local food pantry to get groceries and our local church to ask for a little help to buy monthly medications.\u00a0\nThey next day, we made our first trip to the local food pantry.\u00a0I could tell my parents felt embarrassed by needing to ask for help with groceries.\u00a0The workers welcomed us and tried to help mom and dad feel comfortable.\u00a0One lady walked over to me and asked if she could show me something while my parents were getting boxes of groceries.\u00a0We walked over to a long white table that was covered in little paper packets.\u00a0The packets had pictures of vegetables on them. She asked me if I would like to have some packets of seeds so I could grow my own veggies.\u00a0My eyes got wide and I said, \u201cYes!\u201d.\u00a0 She gave me one packet each of green beans, carrots, corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and peppers.\u00a0The nice lady told me how to plant the seeds and what to do to keep them growing.\u00a0She also said that if I forgot what she told me that the directions were on the back of each seed packet.\u00a0I thanked her for the seeds and told her I would plant them as soon as I got home.\u00a0She put the seed packets in a brown paper lunch bag and gave them to me.\u00a0I smiled and ran out the door to the car with my bag of treasures in my hand.\u00a0Mom and dad were just closing the trunk of the car.\u00a0I excitedly told them all about the seeds, how to plant them, and how to take care of them.\u00a0They laughed at my excitement and said they would help get me started.\u00a0Together, we put all of the groceries away when we got home then we went outside.\u00a0Mom found flower pots and bags of potting soil in the garage and dad dug up a small section of sod in the backyard and used a hoe to soften the soil.\u00a0I carefully planted the seeds and dad helped me with the water hose and showed me how to twist the nozzle for a light shower spray for the seeds. I was so very happy!\u00a0\nLater that evening after supper, we drove to our church.\u00a0I sat on the church steps as my parents went inside.\u00a0The sun was shining and the cool air felt good.\u00a0I thought about the seeds I had planted and wondered how much they may have grown since we planted them earlier that day. I was smiling to myself thinking about the veggies that would be growing soon.\u00a0I also wondered if there would be enough veggies to give to my neighbors to help them since everyone was having the same job problems.\u00a0My parents came out of the church looking relaxed for the first time in several months.\u00a0I felt like everything was going to be ok.\u00a0\nAs soon as we got back home, I ran behind the house to check on my seeds.\u00a0My mouth dropped.\u00a0Everything looked the same.\u00a0Nothing had changed.\u00a0I turned around and cupped my hands around my mouth and yelled, \u201cMom! Dad! Someone stole my seeds!\u201d\u00a0They came out the back door and looked at me.\u00a0They grinned from ear to ear.\u00a0Mom said, \u201cJohnny, it takes several days for the seeds to be in the soil before they start popping up.\u201d\u00a0I just hung my head down and walked towards the house.\u00a0I was so disappointed.\u00a0That night as I went to bed and said my prayers, I thanked God for helping my parents today and for the vegetable seeds.\u00a0I also asked God if he would help them grow.\u00a0I finished up my prayers, said \u201cAmen\u201d then fell into a deep sleep.\nI woke up early the next morning, got dressed, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth then ran outside to the backyard to check out my garden.\u00a0Everything looked the same but I wasn\u2019t as disappointed as yesterday since mom said it would take a few days for the seeds to start growing.\u00a0I turned on the water hose and lightly watered my seeds.\u00a0After I finished, I stuck my finger in the soil to make sure it wasn\u2019t too dry.\u00a0It was just right! Dad said if I use too much water at one time that the ground would become soggy and the seeds would rot.\u00a0He said it was best to water them Just a little at a time.\u00a0He was right!\u00a0I turned off the water hose and helped dad clean out the garage.\u00a0A couple of hours later, mom came out and said that lunch was ready.\u00a0We were starved!\u00a0After eating, mom helped me with my school work and I helped her fold laundry then we went outside to help dad finish up in the garage.\u00a0That evening, we had a nice supper thanks to the food pantry. I helped my parents clean up the kitchen and put dishes away.\u00a0I walked outside to look at my garden one last time before going to bed.\u00a0No sign of anything green.\u00a0Just dirt.\nThe next morning I raced outside to the garden again.\u00a0No changes.\u00a0\u201cWhy is it taking so long for the seeds to grow?\u201d I asked myself.\u00a0\u201cGrow up!\u201d I yelled in frustration.\u00a0\u201cPlease, just grow\u201d, I almost cried.\u00a0Mom came outside and said it takes time to learn patience just like it takes time for seeds to grow. Mom held my hand and we walked around to the front of the house.\u00a0Dad was already in the car waiting for us. Dad winked at me and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go fishing!\u201d\u00a0So the three of us went to a nearby lake. We fished and laughed at dad\u2019s jokes while eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Dad caught three trout and mom fried them for supper. We had a great day! I was so tired that I went to bed without looking at my garden that evening.\nI laid in bed as the sun was shining through my bedroom window.\u00a0I could hear mom in the kitchen.\u00a0Dad came to my room to say that breakfast was ready.\u00a0I got dressed, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth and this time I walked out to my garden.\u00a0I didn\u2019t run because I no longer expected to see anything yet. I think I learned patience.\u00a0As I stared down at the soil, I could see just a little bit of green.\u00a0I got on my knees for a closer look.\u00a0\u201cThey grew!\u201d I yelled.\u00a0I could see little green leaves growing everywhere! I was so excited! I ran back in the house and told mom and dad they wouldn\u2019t hear me yell, \u201cGrow up!\u201d anymore because they finally grew!"}
{"title": "A mother's diary", "story": "                                   Date: \near diary,\nToday is mothers day in UK. I just want to celebrate it with my partner and keep the romanticism awake even though after pregnancy my body and confidence is not the same. I love my body for who it brought in this world, but i really look like a mess. For me today isnt just mother's day. For me its also son day as without him i wouldnt be a mother. He is growing so fast. I gave birth to him last year in january. He was 3.68kg. He was so pink. People said i was lucky as i didnt need painkillers or c section. He just came out. From the beginning, by looking at his eyes, i knew that he is gonna be a tough boy, gonna be a cheeky one, but is was gonna also make my life valueble. Time went by and he just didnt stop growing (except the hair he is still a bit bold but i guess hegot that from me as i was the same when i was born). Once he was 6 months we went to take pictures at the studio. And everytime i look at the picture and think how life was different then compared to now. He was calmer than now as he couldnt walk back then.\u00a0He has grown a lot. Is cleverer. Doesnt speak much yet but he runs everywhere and really does understand you when you speak to him. We try to teach him 2\u00bd languages (yes english greek and a bit of italian as my partner family doesnt speak english and the only language i communicate with my partner is english as we are in UK and a bit of italian because.... who doesnt want to learn italian but obviously also because im from there) then by 10 months he started walking. So since then we use the stroller less. We walk together to places or i carry him. The stroller was just occupying a lot of space so im glad is walking. But i still use it when i need to go somewhere far and he simply doesnt mind it. I love when he used to sleep on my chest, when i hold is tiny hand back then and I love it even more now as when I cuddle him he cuddles me back. When i lie down sometimes comes to me to cuddle my arm and my face. I give him a huge kiss and then he runs away ready to destroy the house once again. The more he grows the more i feel he wants to be more indipendent and i like that its a normal process of growing. Very soon is gonna start going to school and make new friends and do new sports. Having a busy schedule as every kid should, to be honest. It is better for a kid to go school and do an extra curricular activity so that they can born all that energy, than just sit at home after school, because lets be honest. They dont sit at home. They have that energy and they gonna mess up the house with it. Tornado. Thats why let them free outside so that when they come inside the house they are exhausted and they will just eat, shower and then sleep. The truth is that everyone is growing. My son made me mature as a persone. He taught me real love. He taught me real patience. But as a young mother, i am growing as well. Growing becoming the best version of myself. Avoiding negativity. Because the past is full of mistakes that we really wish that we could avoided, but are just there and thanks to those experience we are who we are. The negativity in people, in things. I used to feel upset when i receive a bad comment but now i just try my best to avoid these kind of people that all they know is how to judge others. I want my son to learn that some people are troubled in their head and instead of fixing themselves they try to find mistakes in others. I want my son to be strong enough, so that those people's words won't affect him. I want him to grow strong and healthy. I want him to grow mature enough to understand that everyone makes mistakes and to forgive me if i ever do him wrong. Today he's not feeling that well. He's teething so he has a bit of temperature. It breaks my heart thinking that at this early age you still suffer to grow up. But I guess this is all about. Suffering to grow. It can be phisically or emotionally. My job as a mother is to be there, not to prevent from suffering, but for helping heal, so that he can grow as a healthy strong man. The only thing i pray for is to be a good mother. I try my best but I think it is never enough. He is my sunshine indeed, he feels my days with joy and with craziness. But i cant just be a fun mom, i need to teach him stuff, you know, discipline him. Will I be able to do so? Will I be able to be the perfect mom? Probably not, but I will work my hardest to make sure he lacks nothing and for him to always feel loved by us. That's why I will keep you, my little diary, with me and I will read every page where I talk about him to him. I will read it as a bedtime story, I will sing it. Let my son know that his mom is an artist and that she shows her love through affection and art such as this page of diary.\nI will keep you updated about his reaction or if he's going to rip it off before I even read it to him as he's just one and loves ripping pages of everything\nGoodnight\n(Ps: John, don't rip off this page, mommy is watching you)"}
{"title": "Home of the Brave", "story": "A mom\u2019s job is never truly finished\u2014Elise knew this instinctively when her son was born.\u00a0For at least the hundredth time, she sat next to his bed in that chair mending his quilt. There was no way of knowing, the day she bought it at a flea market, that it would become her son\u2019s most valued possession.\u00a0\nTo call it a quilt stretched the definition as it was nothing more than a thousand pieces of oddly shaped swatches stitched together, layer after layer, until the whole of it was thick enough to hold in the warmth of a small boy's body as he drifted off to sleep. The person who pieced together this labor of love must have spent countless hours shaping the useless remnants into a usable blanket.\u00a0Elise felt it was her duty to repair the inevitable rips as an homage to the unknown creator and as a manifestation of her adoration for the little boy who cherished it.\n\u201cI love how cool it feels when I first get into bed,\u201d her little man observed the first night he wrapped himself in the old quilt. \u201cBut before long, it warms up, and I\u2019m snug as a bug in a rug. Where did you get it?\u201d\u00a0\nThe question was one whose answer was too mundane to inflict on a wide eyed little boy, so Elise stretched the truth just a little. \u201cIt was brought over on the Mayflower by the Pilgrims,\u201d she answered to her son's delight. \u201cIt\u2019s made from pieces of fabric from all over Europe and is the first blanket used by the first Americans.\u201d\nIt was just a little white lie, but it was also the beginning of a cherished tradition.\u00a0As stitches unraveled and as tears ripped the quilt and the little boy's heart, Elise sat by his bed and mended the heirloom. Then she would continue the \"true\" story of how the quilt\u00a0had found its way to her son.\u00a0\n\u201cDuring the Revolutionary War, your quilt was captured by General Cornwallis and used to keep his legs warm on the cold winter nights.\u201d Elise said, weaving a story as intricate as the blanket itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the surrender at Yorktown that it was returned.\u201d\n\u201cYorktown?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Yorktown,'' she said smiling, \u201cGeorge Washington took it from Cornwallis and used it during his eight years as president.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean my blanket has been to the White House?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOf course it has,\u201d Elise answered with a wink. \u201cBut not because of George Washington, silly. John Adams was the first president to live in the White House.\u201d\n\u201cWho then, Mom? ``The little boy asked., \u201cWho took my blanket to the White House?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a story for later,\u201d Elise replied, kissing her son on his forehead. \u201cNow you get some sleep, and I\u2019ll continue the story next time.\u201d\nElise, unfortunately, had far too many opportunities to continue the blanket\u2019s tale as her son was given to debilitating headaches. At first, the doctors thought he was prone to systemic migraines, but the truth was much worse. Many nights, too many, the little boy would curl up in pain, his teeth clenched in a faux smile. The headaches were excruciating, only soothed by a cold wash cloth, his mother\u2019s gentle voice, and the telling of the quilt\u2019s tale as he drifted off to sleep.\u00a0\nThere were also many a night where Elise would sit with her son as he slept, meticulously piecing back together the tears that threatened the blanket entirely, wishing there was a way she could also mend her son. The room would be completely quiet save for the sound of Elise\u2019s song. It was something she had done since she was his age. Inadvertently yet intentionally she would let the air slip through her lips, creating a tune just for him that would live for that moment, replaced the next time by one equally beautiful and equally unique.\n\u201cAs it turns out, the first time the quilt made it to the White House was just after Abraham Lincoln was elected president,\u201d Elise said the next night, continuing the story from where they\u2019d left off. The pain had become more frequent and more intense, requiring more chapters more often. The story's continuation, however, had the desired results, a distraction and a smile.\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln, he used my quilt, too?\u201d her son asked, too young to doubt his mother.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Elise responded, tickling her son just to hear him laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a little known fact, but Mount Rushmore was actually created to show all of the presidents who used your blanket.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nElise always had a basin of cold water by her side whenever she sat with her son. Very early on she learned that the coolness of the cloth would help quiet the pain in his head. It was her greatest joy to moisten the cloth keeping it cold throughout her story. The little boy\u2019s head still throbbed, but while his mom was telling the story she would gently wipe his forehead with the cold cloth, and it was almost as if he forgot the pain for a time. If all went well, he would fall asleep listening to the tale of his blanket, as sleep was becoming his only relief from the pain.\n\u201cDid you know your blanket went to the moon?\u201d Elise asked one day when her son seemed particularly down. \u201cNeil Armstrong may have been the first man to set foot on the moon, but he laid out your quilt so he and Buzz Aldrin could have a picnic.\u201d\u00a0\nThe idea of two astronauts having a picnic on the moon resulted in spontaneous laughter for both mother and son.\u00a0\n\u201cIs Buzz Lightyear named after Buzz Aldrin?\u201d he asked his mom, as both continued to laugh.\n\u201cAs a matter of fact he was,\u201d Elise replied with a smile. \u201cIf you must know, Buzz Aldrin presented your quilt to Buzz Lightyear as a gift which means your blanket has been\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTo infinity and beyond!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Elise confirmed as she refreshed his cloth and placed it back on his head.\nDay after day she would take her boy to doctors and then specialists and eventually to the hospital. Then, night after night, she would sit by his bed and tell the story of the quilt. Elise did everything she could to stretch out the story, and as each new adventure was passed from mother to son so too was hope, in the only way she knew how.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe night that she finished the story was, in so many ways, just like most of the other nights. Elise was home in her favorite chair next to her son\u2019s bed. Her breathing was labored and her voice unsteady. \u201cAnd then I stopped by a flea market on my way home from the store and there it was, your beautiful, wonderful blanket. I knew you must have it, so I scooped it up, paid the nice woman, and brought it home to you.\u201d\nTears filled Elise\u2019s eyes as she sewed the last stitch on the old quilt. Holding it up, she remembered the first time her son covered himself with the blanket. \n\u201cIt\u2019s finally fixed. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d\u00a0Elise said out loud, tears continuing to flow. \u201cI love how cool it feels, too.\u201d\u00a0\nSummoning every bit of her strength, she lay the beloved blanket on the empty bed in front of her.\u00a0\nBeing a mom is a job that is never truly finished, at least she had hoped so. With nothing else left to do for her son, she sat back in the chair and silently sobbed.\u00a0"}
{"title": "Night Vision: Remembering the Future", "story": "I\u2019ve been to such a place so unimaginable, that even after sharing my experience, you would not be able to fathom what I have seen, felt, or witnessed. But\u2026this is my attempt to share with you what is beyond. Beyond comprehension. Beyond what we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe to be real or fake.\nIt was a Wednesday late afternoon, November 18th to be exact. I finally arrived home after a long day at work. My feet are throbbing, I\u2019m starved, and ready to crash. Eat or sleep first? Those were the options that faced my evening. I could barely think of anything but my bed. Welp! That was that! I threw my heels off, quickly changed my clothes into a very large, oversized tee-shirt. I walked over to the left side of my bed, lifted the blanket up and over, climbed into bed, and covered myself. I let out a deep sigh that sounded like \u201cthe anxious wait is over\u201d. I scooted towards the edge of the bed to have one leg out and my arm bent slightly over the edge. Before I realized it, I was out for the count!\nJust when I thought I would have a peaceful rest, suddenly, I was being pulled up and out of my bed. Did you catch that? I was being pulled up and out of my bed. I was confused, frightened and amazed. I couldn\u2019t choose which emotion to settle in. I looked down to see how far up I am, but to my surprise, I saw my body lying there! I kept blinking and shaking my head to try and snap out of it, but nothing worked. I finally looked up to see what or who was pulling me upward, and it was a bright-lighted being. I began to wiggle and yell for help. This bright entity, this person whom I could only guess was an angelic being, looked down at me and descended to my eye level, placed its hand on my head, then on my right shoulder. The light-being then says, \u201cPeace\u201d. That\u2019s all. Just \u201cpeace\u201d. But that was all it took for me to truly be calm and comfortable with this new experience. We continued upward, out of my house. Then over the city. Eventually, we were above the country, then the face of the earth! We traveled past the clouds towards the darkness of space! I looked up at this angel and asked, \u201cPlease, where are you taking me?\u201d The light being's response was, \u201cDo you not know?\u201d I was confused by this, like come on! This is my first rodeo.\nI remained silent because I was in awe of what I saw next. We were headed to only what I could describe as a translucent, wavy-like substance that reflected all kinds of colors. Colors I couldn\u2019t describe even if I tried. We got closer and I couldn\u2019t believe what it was! \u201cIs\u2026is that water\u201d? I asked. Before I knew it, we were traveling through water in space! But this wasn\u2019t ordinary water. I didn\u2019t drown. My lungs didn\u2019t fill with water. I\u2019m not sure if that is because my actual body is back at home in my bed or not. I just know that what I am experiencing is unimaginable. Oh, how to describe how this body of water felt. It was like touching life. I could feel this water protecting me in some way. It was as if I was submerged in 100% certainty and knowing what that felt like, truly. No, I got it\u2026it felt like I went through absolute truth. Through the water, I looked up and I could see many colors of light becoming deeper in contrast as we were about to come out. As we emerged from the watery-like portal, I was coated with the water. I then looked down to see what I was standing on. I can only describe it as a dragon-glass-like surface. I was full of amazement. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked, looking at the water coating my body. The angel finally released me and answered, \u201cYou are not yet in a form that can stand here. The water covering you are meant to protect\u201d. Wait?! Where is \u201chere\u201d? I had nearly forgotten this isn\u2019t Kansas anymore.\nThe light-being motioned me to follow. As I followed along, I looked around me and I saw many beautiful colors glowing and flowing all around. I continued to explore with my eyes and saw more light-beings bringing other people like me through the water portal. I thought to myself, this must be like how we take a train and arrive at the station where people are waiting to board or depart to go to their next destination. I was shocked and honestly relieved. I was about to yell out to a person I saw in the distance but my guide, the light-being, stopped me and said, \u201cThis journey is for you. Come.\u201d I nodded in agreement and walked alongside. We approached a watery barrier that towered so far past the eye view! It was massive! Much like the water portal we just passed through. \u201cDo you know where you are? Do you know why you are here?\u201d the guide asked. I, without shame, replied, \u201cNo. I do not know where I am or why I am here. Am I dead? Is this heaven?\u201d He replied, \u201cNo Olivia. You have not passed on. This is not heaven.\u201d I looked around again and at the water barrier, \u201cIs this a special realm? Is there such a thing as realms?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes. You are about to enter the vision realm.\u201d He removed his gaze from me to look toward the water barrier. \u201cThis is where you will see many wonders. You will see the present or you may see the future whether it is pleasant or destruction and death. You see what they choose for you to see\u201d, the guide explained. \u201cWait! Who are \n?\u201d The guide doesn\u2019t answer, he instead extends his hand and points toward the water barrier. I could only assume that means go through. I took a deep breath, I stuck my hand in first, then quickly retracted it. I took a step back and began shaking in fear. The guide touched my back and said, \u201cPeace\u201d. I took another deep breath, relaxed my shoulders, lifted my head, and proceeded through.\nI can't believe what I am seeing. It\u2019s like a war-stricken city. It\u2019s horrible! Buildings are in ruins and smoke arises from them. People running and screaming in fear and agony. I can no longer see myself, it's like I\u2019m viewing this through a lens. I feel like a fly on the wall. I continue to look on and see a modern-looking warrior running and taking cover multiple times as if they were on a mission. I see others like her following her lead. She\u2019s decked with dirt-soiled clothes, combat boots, black gloves, an automatic weapon roped around her chest, a quiver with many arrows on her back, and the bow and arrow in her hands. Her hair is pulled back, her face covered in dirt and blood smudges. She looks focused and afraid at the same time. \u201cWait\u2026is that me? That\u2019s me!\u201d I exclaimed. I continued to look. I, the warrior, carefully cross a parking lot with burning cars, trash, and debris to the entry of a partially bombed building. This warrior, well me stops at the entryway, grabs the automatic weapon to look through the sniper scope to look out for nearby threats. She then motions the rest to hurry and cross through the parking lot and meet her. She opens the door, and everyone is pouring through. As the last one runs through the door, she looks out once more and closes the door behind her. They descend to the lowest floor of the building where it seems like survivors are holding up. There are children, men, and women all in their assigned areas. Everyone seems to have a role to play to survive. You can see some sorting rations, others building and repairing weapons. Even children are being taught to play their part in the survival efforts. I can only feel an atmosphere filled with nothing but sorrow. Some seem just too tired to carry on like this. Some are duty-focused. No matter the countenance of the people, none had joy or happiness. Only fear and a strong determination to survive the day. I\u2019ve never felt such sadness. I enter a room where other group leaders are gathered to debrief. There\u2019s a table with an atlas laid out and a whiteboard with assignments lines and graphs drawn on it. I walk over to my place in the room, and someone yells out, \u201cThank God, you made it!\u201d Others clap their hands and warmly welcome me back. I nodded in gratitude and called the meeting to order. \u201cWe just heard word in the East sector that the military figured us out. We must\u2026\u201d\nSuddenly the dream was fading, and I could no longer hear what was being said! It was like I was being pulled out of the dream. I kept saying, \u201cWait! Wait! There\u2019s more! Bring me back! Wait\u201d! Next thing I know the right side of my body was hurting. I looked down and around, and realized I was back in my room and fell off the bed! I began patting the floor, the wall, and my bed, then finally my face to see if I was truly back. Well, back in my body that is. I was indeed back. And before I knew it, I was fully overtaken with emotions. I began to cry and even chuckled a little bit. I asked myself, \u201cDid I really just leave this earth and enter a whole new dimension?\u201d Did I really witness wonder and devastation all in the same experience? I couldn't go back to sleep. I had to tell everyone and warn them! I told my family and friends. I wrote to TV and radio stations of that night, November 18th, the night I slept and traveled beyond. But literally, everyone thinks I\u2019m touched in the head! They all think I\u2019m crazy. But I\u2019m not crazy, you see. I know things that the average person can\u2019t handle, that's all. I took a deep breath after ranting on and looked around at white padded walls, the plainly covered bed, and the psychiatrist looking down at his pad, writing down his observations. I quickly remembered nothing I'm saying will ever matter. I\u2019m trapped in the one place I will never be heard. The psychiatrist, Dr. Zamdine says, \u201cSo, Olivia, you\u2019ve been here for 2 years now. We had hoped your delusions of grandeur would gradually fade away. But it seems you are still a danger to yourself and others.\u201d I looked toward the black tempered soundproof glass as if I knew there were others behind it observing me. I yelled, \u201cYou know I\u2019m right! That\u2019s why I'm here, isn\u2019t it! But I won't be for long. You\u2019ll see!\u201d Dr. Zamdine, held a slight smirk saying sternly, \u201cUntil you recover\u2026you WILL remain, right\u2026here\u201d. He rose from his chair and took it with him as he exited the room. I angrily stared him down as he left. I laid back down, faced the wall, clenched my fist in anger. I then began to cry silently from frustration and confusion. I couldn\u2019t fathom why I would be shown such wonder and of an apocalypse to come only to suffer this fate. While I lay in sorrow, suddenly I felt a warm hand on my right shoulder. I immediately stopped crying because I recognized that feeling. It was my guide! I then heard, \u201cPeace unto you Dreamer of dreams. Peace.\u201d I smiled, relaxed and closed my eyes to sleep. When I woke, I was laying down in my bed, in the same oversized tee-shirt I put on before I laid down to sleep. I popped up from my bed, sweating and breathing heavily. I immediately got out of bed and tripped all over the place as I frantically ran into the other rooms of my house. I got to my kitchen and opened the window to smell and feel the cool crisp air outside on my skin. I needed to know I was truly back home! I ran back to my room, stood at the doorway of my bedroom, and fell on my knees with my eyes full of tears. Many thoughts raced through my head. So many emotions pulsating through the center of my being. I realized this wasn\u2019t just a dream from bad Thai food I had for lunch. No. I was chosen to see what the end will be.\nMost cannot handle what I have just told you. But I think you know exactly what I am talking about. Don\u2019t you? Do you recall when I told you I saw others with their guides emerging from the water portal? Well, I think you are one of them! I have spent 5 years trying to track down others like me\u2026like us. Those who have been where we have been and may be seen what we\u2019ve seen. I strongly believe that we all have seen the same future apocalypse in pieces. Like a puzzle, we are to come together to complete the picture! I know I\u2019m right about you! I can see it in your eyes. I haven\u2019t told a living soul \u2018til now because the dream warned of what would happen if I just went around telling everyone the fate of the world. Right now, only a Dreamer of Dreams can hear what we have seen. I've come all this way and have risked everything by sharing what I\u2019ve seen with you. Will you join me in finding the others and begin preparing for what is to come? Or will you take the easy way out and pretend it was just a dream? The choice\u2026is yours."}
{"title": "The Locked Door", "story": "There once was a curious little boy who was an absolute delight to be in the company of. Eyes so bright they outshine the sky and a smile so wide and contagious it\u2019d make grumpy Uncle Bob crack a grin. Young in age and young in spirit, he sought out adventure as any other kid would. He was always determined to uncover mysteries of this beautiful house he called home. In this peaceful home lived an elegant mum of a giddy little boy and his name was Thomas.\nHis toes spread out across the cold wooden floor as he stretched as tall as his little body would let him. The glowing evening sun slowly seeped onto his eager fingers that were reaching for the door knob only a few inches out of his reach. Though his young back began to ache, he gave no sign of giving in. Licking his lips at the thought of the mountain of homemade chocolate chip cookies he was desperately hoping were piled up behind the door. He adjusted his current position, switching arms as if his right were longer than the other, this was turning out to be quite the challenge. Shifting his weight from left to right, his feather footing was as quiet as a mouse, this was not his first attempt. His heart raced a thousand miles as he knew the time was ticking, mum would catch him at any moment.\nHe first saw the cupboard a few weeks prior, when mum was making supper one evening. She\u2019d sung soulful jazz over the record as she danced in her baby pink and blue apron, sliding gracefully around the kitchen. Thomas loved evening time with mumma, she was just so pretty and sounded like a sweet bird in the morning. He was so giggly and magnetized by his mum that he almost didn\u2019t notice the secret door within the pantry she'd just swooped out of. Leaving the door open, just enough for two blue curious eyes to peer into, he locked his sight on a mystery he so desperately needed to uncover. Without a second thought, he climbed down from the chair and raced so fast he thudded across the floor smacking head on\u00a0 into the main door of the pantry. Drenched in a hard ache, he cried and screamed until mummy picked him up and held him in her arms for at least a few minutes. That one really hurt.\u00a0\nThomas had been thinking about the secret cupboard ever since he\u2019d discovered it. Although a bit sore, he was not disheartened by his first attempt in unlocking the secret contents behind the locked door. It was more than just curiosity in his child mind that kept his fire burning, the excitement and thrill of sneaking around to make an exceptional discovery was far more motivating. This discovery would be the first of many he endured to uncover. We all have to start somewhere.\u00a0\nIt was the first thing on his mind as he arrived at day-care and when the other kids wanted to play; \u201cCome on Thomas!\u201d, \u201cCome play on the swings!\u201d he retreated into his little nook in the tree, scheming. How does a four a year old become capable of accessing a secret door that's much, much greater than he is? What would it take to achieve this task that had been set in stone, engraved on his little mind after first laying his eyes on the mystery cupboard? He decided he needed time on his side, he\u2019d wait till it was time for his bath, the only time when mum would be upstairs, and he\u2019d have a few moments alone to complete the mission.\n \nThat afternoon, as he was pulling his body upwards as best as he possibly could, he began to feel a bit hopeless, he just wasn\u2019t tall enough. Jumping and stretching, changing hands and feet just wasn\u2019t making him any closer to the brass knob above. Then it came to him, in his determined little mind, he realised that although he couldn\u2019t make himself taller, something else would! Exploding with excitement and with a mischievous grin at his genius plan, he raced over to the other side of the kitchen and slowly dragged a screeching kitchen chair over to the pantry. One small, but committed step at a time he crawled up on the chair where he triumphantly stood up. He\u2019d almost done it! He was so close! His hand reached the dusty knob which ruled over the rest of the shelves in this kingdom of goods and non-perishables. Pulling with all his might and two hands, like his entire childhood depended on it, he squealed excitedly, but the unexpected happened, the door was locked! Before he knew it, one last aggressive tug at the knob had\u00a0 sent him flying backwards off all limbs. His heart had left his chest and stayed up in the clouds as his body plummeted before the fast approaching ground below. As the cold smack of the timber waited for poor Thomas, a warm embrace scooped him up and spun him around before he knew what had happened. His mum had been there in the nick of time to save him from a nasty fall.\u00a0\nAfter a big fright, a long bath and some stern words from mummy, Thomas was exasperated from the day's events and was longing for his bed. He really believed he could do it, he could unlock the mystery that burned through his bones each day, a door longing to be opened. What on earth could be in that cupboard? After two attempts now, he pondered how to tackle it again for the third and final time.\u00a0\nAs Thomas was sunk into the chair in disappointment after some warm milk, he just noticed mum creeping into the kitchen with a key in hand and disappeared into the war zone he\u2019d only just survived a few hours earlier. She came out with a smile sewed onto her face and gleaming eyes; \u201cOnly just this once, Tommy.\u201d And she served him an old china tea cup, on which was placed a homemade chocolate chip biscuit, baked by his favourite person in the world. His golden treat! - kept all this time, behind the locked door.\u00a0\n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "From bubbles to burst and boost!", "story": "Buoyed by the principles plus precepts learnt from watching a few YouTube videos on skiing well and without fear as a novice, I set off down the snowy slope with a significant sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! This euphoric feeling was as indescribable as it was enjoyable. This wind at my back turned to temporal dysphoria as I crashed into someone while seeking to employ a wedge stop technique practiced a few times after watching the how-tos.\n \nA more experienced skier auspiciously came to the rescue of my \"victim\" as I steadily moved to a safe spot.\n \nBasking in the euphoria of fully skiing for the very first time made me forgetful about avoiding an accident... The person I crashed into and the rescuer continued down the hill after slowing down to confirm I was okay. I muttered a rapid prayer of Thanksgiving to God for safety. With this done, I was back in high spirits ready to continue with increased care and competence. I sure wasn't ready to give up!\n \nThe more daunting the task, the more daring I can be. This disposition describes me since attempting to date a dancer I met while on duty in a departmental store where I briefly worked.\n \nHer velvety voice saying \"Excuse me sir, do you work here by any chance?\" as she sought out a particular product principally \"pulled\" me to her as I thought \"this lady must be 'mine' if she's not already hooked up with anyone!\" Her svelte silhouette surely sealed my stance as I blurted out \"are you married or in any serious relationship with any man?\"\n \nFlabbergasted and flushed, she fumbled for words to say without being overly brutish or brutalizing my ego...\n \n... flustered but not feeling foolish, I found the courage to correct course by saying \"Yes, I work here but I'm very honoured to have been blessed with the chance of meeting you. Would you please forgive my being rash even though I'm truly interested in  knowing you?\"\n \nThe fury on her face faded into a smile that made me further think \"this woman and I sure need to become close friends\". She then responded by saying \"it's okay as I see that you are not the highly insensitive and incongruous individual I initially thought you were...; but I must say you're intrepid!\" \"intre..what?\" I replied. \"You're interestingly fearless and forthrightly bold\", she\u00a0said\u00a0as we both burst out laughing. Then I introduced myself and she reciprocated.\u00a0\n \nShe was in search of silver coloured swimsuits she could adapt as costume for the next dance presentation of her troupe. On showing her the pertinent section of the store, I proposed two complementary colours - light purple and light blue - to her.\n \nShe accepted my propositions and profusely thanked me as I escorted her to the till area. As she joined the queue, I excused myself muttering \"I'll be back in a jiffy.\" I dashed to pick up my stuff as my shift for the day was now over. But my section manager requested help to reset his computer and thus an unexpected quarter of an hour! On returning to the till, she was nowhere in sight but the cashier handed me a note tucked inside an envelope from her.\n \nExcited and curious but unwilling to show my disappointment mixed with anticipation, I calmly put the envelope in my knapsack and headed home, a few blocks away. On getting into my studio apartment, I quickly opened the envelope hoping to therein find her phone number and request to be called, but alas, it was not so.\n \nThe little note in one of the loveliest handwriting ever sighted simply read: \"Good things come to those who wait for and merit them. Sorry I could no longer wait as I have a plane to catch and billed to be back in six weeks after a tour with my team. I hope to answer your two-in-one question on my return if the wait turns out to be worthwhile for us both. Meeting you was a memorable encounter. Thank you once again and take care.\u00a0- Your 'yet-to-be' friend.\"\n \n\"Six weeks!? I'm scheduled to also leave town in two weeks as my sojourn at the departmental store comes to an end in a week!\" I thought to myself.\n \nThat was six months ago.\n \nNow in Switzerland for a sixteen-week writing project, I came in three days ago, a week before the expected commencement of this plum job. This is in order to take advantage of a stay offered to me in a resort owned by the parents of a Swiss friend I met three years ago at a writing conference. It also affords me the opportunity to enjoy a dream activity - skiing.\n \nThe following morning, on the way to a breakfast of r\u00f6sti, raclette and lamb in one of the restaurants, the chit-chat of a motley crew could be heard behind me... Suddenly, a particular voice stopped me in my tracks as my heart skipped a beat and I trembled with unbelief. \"Was I finally going to see her again? Is that not the velvety voice I've been longing to hear for the past half-year?\"\n \nTurning back, her instant recognition of me was a welcome validation. \"Oh my goodness, we finally meet again!\", she said, as she rushed towards me and beaming, I instinctively threw my hands wide open for her to crash into.\n \nWe struggled to outdo each other in playing catch up. It seemed so serene and sensible to be together. With breakfast and others around us immediately put on hold, hand in hand, we gravitated towards a nearby face to face bench and settled in.\n \nShe looked so beautiful I wished I could watch her all day that day and every other day! All anxieties about what to say if we ever met again had disappeared into thin air.\n \nShe regaled me with stories of how, on her return from the tour, she had\u00a0gone back to the departmental store many times every week for six weeks to look for me (or get information that could reconnect her with me) before giving up.\n \nFor an inexplicable reason, I had brought her note with me on this trip. More curious was the fact that I read it just before leaving my room and ended up putting it in my shirt pocket. Reaching therefore into my pocket, I brought it out and I could see her liven up even more as she gasped in surprise.\n \n\"Oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, you still have the note with you. When I couldn't find you, I wished I had left my contact details in it\", she said.\n \nOn flipping open the note and putting it sideways for it to be readable, we chorused the first sentence: \"Good things come to those who wait for and merit them.\"\n "}
{"title": "A reticent but resolute carer at work.", "story": "Reticent but resolute, he waltzed into the kitchen to make her the tea recently requested. The hum of the freezer fused into a samba with the sound of the kettle at work. Immediately, his mind wandered to what the weekend ahead would be like if the expected helper does not show up.\n \nThe last few weeks of having to take care of her more than ever before have been really stressful.\u00a0They were however made more bearable by her brother as well as his deep love for them both. But now that her beloved brother\u00a0is billed to return to his base later today, an appropriate assistant will be absolutely appreciated.\u00a0He also remembered he would need to intimate her of the important call she has to expect.\u00a0Just then, the popping sound signifying the water coming to boiling point snaps him out of his reverie.\n \nWith a deftness that has become second nature by reason of the last two decades, he promptly made the tea while not forgetting to add her favourite flavouring! He quickly took it to her, piping hot, as she likes it. \n \nHe watched satisfyingly as she took the tea, sweating profusely but becoming less pale with every sip. He also looked forward to hearing her habitual \u201cThank you; that was really nice!\u201d\u00a0Additionally, seeing the contentment mixed with gratitude on her face\u00a0is usually priceless. Thankfully, the worst is likely over according to the last check of the doctors.\u00a0But what exactly is the situation? What would the expected result to the last series of tests be? \u201cIt\u2019s time to tell her about the call\u201d, he resolved.\n \nAs he was about to broach the subject, her telephone started to ring. Startled, she looked at him with a questioning frown. He immediately understood her thought: \u201cWhen did you switch on my phone? I thought we agreed to leave it off until early next week when we put it off a week ago!\u201d\n \n\u201cSweetheart, it is true it was to stay off for at least ten days so you could have sufficient time to rest, relax and recuperate... But the youngest of your doctors called me yesterday night to complain that he had been trying to reach you without success\u2026\u00a0hence I switched it on this morning just before you woke up. I was actually just about to tell you\", he lovingly said.\n \nAppreciating\u00a0him, she downed the remainder of the tea and reached for the phone.\u00a0He briskly picked up the mug and sauntered back into the kitchen.\u00a0Though anxious to know what was so important that the doctor insisted on personally telling her, he proceeded to making a special breakfast for her, her brother and himself. Spanish eggs with spinach and prawns have never failed to cheer everyone up. This delicacy became a family favourite on an holiday trip to Spain seven years ago. On that trip, a brown-eyed boy did not drown because of her brother\u2019s heroic act.\n \nWhat more? It was on that trip he invented a game in which one player swims to reach a throne in order to receive a golden brown crown while dodging drone attacks of the other player and simultaneously ensuring that the baby being held does not drown. Fortunately, he made a substantial amount and still gets some residual income from the idea. The game company that purchased it still produces and profitably sells.\n \nMeanwhile, she exchanged pleasantries with the doctor and apologized for having been unreachable before\u00a0explaining\u00a0why. He sheepishly told her there were two very important reasons for his call.\u00a0With a curious and somewhat worrisome look, she gingerly started walking out of the room in search of her loving and committed carer. She definitely did not want to hear whatever this dainty doctor had to say alone.\n \nEager to reach the kitchen before allowing the conversation to continue, she asked him to kindly hold on for a few minutes...\n \nOn reaching the threshold of the kitchen, the appetizing aroma of the Spanish eggs with spinach and prawns made her give a thumbs up to her \u201ccurrent chief chef\u201d before motioning\u00a0to him to please keep quiet and listen in on the conversation with her...\n \nSwiftly putting the phone on speaker mode, she thanked the doctor for holding on and asked him to continue the discussion.\u00a0The doctor then announced that the first reason for calling was professional while the other was personal. On the professional level, he informed her that the last test carried out on her was a false positive so she could relax more and expect to fully recover within a week.\n \nWith tears of joy streaming down her face, she collapsed into a chair by the dining table and the telephone fell from her hand. Highly alert and attentive, her chief carer used his shoes to cushion the fall of the smartphone, picked it up, told the doctor to please call back in five minutes,\u00a0then cuddled\u00a0her in his arms, rejoicing with and thanking God for her.\n \n\u201cMy little girl,\u00a0now a lovely lady,\u00a0has been spared the agony of having a terminal disease!\u201d, he\u00a0thought to himself. The loss of her mother - his wife\u00a0- twenty years ago when she was just a little over two years old and her brother was five, seemed like yesterday. He recalled resolving to take care of them\u00a0as resiliently\u00a0as possible even if he would have to constantly battle reticence!\n \nLike clockwork, the doctor called back in five minutes. By this time, she had regained her composure.\u00a0Picking up with gusto,\u00a0she responded \u2026\u00a0\u201cyes, my dear doctor, thanks for the good news you just gave me!\u201d Stuttering, he asked if she was okay and sought to know what really happened\u00a0when he heard a thud before her father abruptly requested\u00a0he call back. Smiling, she told him it was essentially a momentary but momentous assimilation of what was said. Still stammering, he wondered aloud if he could\u00a0progress\u00a0to the personal discourse.\n \nAt this juncture, her father discreetly disappeared so as to let them freely talk...\n \nWith a teasing tone, she told him she was now all alone before enquiring\u00a0if he was shy.\u00a0He solemnly replied,\u00a0\u201cI'm shy\u00a0but\u00a0not sly.\u201d"}
{"title": "Snowed-in by Choice", "story": "Snow danced in the wind outside the frosted windows of her small chalet. This was a cold wind, sharp as a slap and just as shocking against bare skin. It caught the small snowflakes and swirled them into heavy drifts against her chalet\u2019s walls. \n \nShe watched the snow dance and swirl from snug inside her chalet, tucked close to a crackling fire. This was a real fire, wooden logs piled high on the hearth to keep it fed and roaring. From her spot \u2014a supremely good spot\u2014 she had a view out the window, along with the rest of the small room and down the hall.\n \nHer chalet was always the first to snowed in when a storm approached. Something about the placement of the building and the wind patterns. The subject bored her so she wandered away or fell asleep when someone tried to explain. \n \nShe watched the wind rattle the trees around her chalet and fling free snow that had managed to cling to the branches. A few people \u2014they must be guests of a nearby chalet\u2014 hurried back to their lodgings. They were foolish wandering out when a winter storm was so close. Their lack of caution could tempt the storm into flexing her muscles to remind them all her potential for destruction.\n \nShe thought them all fools. The guests, that is, who came to the mountain and to her chalet, to engage in their \u201cwinter sports.\u201d She did not understand how anyone enjoyed hurtling down a mountain on thin pieces of wood. Especially in the biting cold. \n \nBut enjoy they did. And complain they did also, especially when the slopes closed ahead of the winter storm. The complainers didn\u2019t seem to care that the slopes closed for their own safety. They had come to hurtle down the mountain and any alternative was subpar.\n \nShe yawned and stretched, shifting to toast a slightly different part of herself in the fire. She had ensconced herself in what was the chalet\u2019s \u201creading room.\u201d It was not as popular as the larger \u201cmedia room\u201d nearby. There the large screen T.V. reigned supreme as it belched forth entertainment for the masses. No, the reading room was quieter and cozier and suited her perfectly.\n \nShe turned from the window to survey the few guests nearby, sharing in the quiet room and warmth of the fireplace. They were a young couple with two children, one a baby asleep against its father\u2019s shoulder. The couple talked in soft voices while an older child \u2014in a painfully bright sweater\u2014 played on the floor. The family was part of a larger group, who she had seen streaming towards the T.V.\u2019s amusements. But only after they made known their complaints about the weather in loud voices.\n \nShe didn\u2019t understand the complaining. A storm was not unexpected this time of year. Encountering one was a risk that went hand-in-hand with these beloved \u201cwinter sports.\u201d Plus, what were the employees, who bore the brunt of the complaints, supposed to do about an act of nature? Clearly there was nothing they could do. But if there was one thing she had learned in her chalet, it was that there were always guests who liked to complain.\n \nShe noticed then that she had caught the attention of the couple's older child. The child stared at her with large, solemn eyes. She stared back for a time, before redirecting her gaze back to the fire. She didn\u2019t mind children, but she also didn\u2019t encourage them. \n \nThe wind gained strength and threw itself against the windows, howling in rage at the obstacle.\u00a0The trees rocked and shook in the winds fury as it directed its frustrations instead against their trunks. These trees had stood in their place for decades upon decades. They had withstood \u2014without yielding ground\u2014 storms stronger than this one would become. \n \nThe howling wind reminded her of the year before when she had briefly been stuck outside. A storm had arisen faster than she had expected and caught her unawares. In her rush back to her chalet, she fell into a snowdrift. There she would have frozen and died mere feet from safety. But rescue came almost immediately. She shivered now at the memory of that cold and how long she had to sit in front of the fire before she felt warm again. She was too old now for such adventures. She had remained close to the chalet since then \u2014when she did choose to venture out. Which was rare, especially if a storm approached. No reason to tempt fate.\n \nShe turned her head at a soft noise nearby. The child had approached her, still staring, and now with a finger in their mouth. They had stopped a few feet away to stare from a closer distance, cautious. She returned the child\u2019s stare and waited to see what the child would do.\n \nShe had no idea how old the child was, except that it was older than the baby sibling nearby. Though herds of children moved in and out of her chalet, she never gained more knowledge about them. Except that she had learned which children to avoid. She was quick to vacate a room when one of those monsters approached. \n \nBut this child was quieter and calmer than the monster children. They crept closer until they leaned against the arm of her chair. Their wide eyes barely seemed to blink as they returned her stare. The finger stayed firmly planted in their mouth.\n \nThe wind gave a sharp howl and a harsh slap to the nearby window. The sudden noise startled the child, who pulled back a few inches from the chair. The child\u2019s stare broke from hers as they turned back to look at their parents for reassurance. But the parents, engrossed in their quiet conversation, did not notice their child. \n \nShe reached out and gently patted the child\u2019s hand, the one not in the child's mouth.\u00a0She wanted to reassure the child, but also she wanted the child\u2019s attention again. She could tell now that this child was not one of the grabby monsters.\n \nSurprised the child turned back to her and their lips parted from their finger in a shy smile. They reached carefully towards her with their free hand, fingers outstretched. She stretched forward to meet those fingers and the child stroked the soft fur between her ears. \n \n\u201cBe careful, Addison,\u201d one of the parents called. \u201cBe gentle with the kitty.\u201d\n \nThe child\u2019s fingers stayed gentle between her ears so she let out a loud rumbling purr in reward.\u00a0A soft giggle escaped from the child, sneaking its way free from around the finger. She closed her eyes. Her purr rumbled deep in her chest and the child continued to pet her between her ears and along her fire toasted side.\n \nDarkness fell outside the window as the snow fell and the wind raged. But inside her chalet all was as she liked it. Because in her experience, being snowed in was much better than being snowed out."}

I think both you and I completely understand it\u2019s a human and \nworld.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, of course. So, do you have any huwoman\u2019s cards?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, sir. If you don\u2019t stop with your offensive archaic patriarchal classifications, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d\n\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cHere at Hallmark, all of our cards are gender neutral and nonbinary.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re trying to tell me that you don\u2019t believe there are two sexes?\u201d\n\u201cThere you go again.\u201d\n\u201c\n. What did I do this time?\u201d\n\u201cYou used the word \n.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me, genders.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there it is again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cSEX-es. EX-cuse. Tell me you didn\u2019t use words with x\u2019s in them\u2014just to make fun of me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d\n\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re using Y. Don\u2019t think I know you aren\u2019t gaslighting me with your references to x and y chromosomes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I need to avoid using the letters x and y? That\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201c\n? You really said \n? We do not recognise age here. We at Hallmark are also non-numeric when it comes to age. Have you been living on a deserted island? Are you Gilligan or Mary Ann?\u201d\n\u201cActually, I prefer Ginger.\u201d\n\u201cYou prefer characters named after seasonings?! You do realize that seasonings are objects, thus you must support the objectification of persons who are neither seasonings nor objects.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not objectifying anyone!\u201d\n\u201cOne? Any\n? Typical of someone who is not supportive of the community. You\u2019ve\u00a0 automatically assumed not only my gender, but also my number. I am not any\n. I am anytwo. And my pronouns are Alpha and Omega.\u201d\n\u201cI understand and thank you for educating me. Now, could we please just start over?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cAt Hallmark, we believe that everyone, everytwo, and everythree can start over. Would you like to see the Starting Over section of our greeting cards?\u201d\n\u201cI would just like a Valentine\u2019s Day card to send my niece\u2014my person\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you own this person?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\n\u201cYou said \u2018my person\u2019 like you owned him or her or they or them or ze or hir or xe or sem or hy or hym . . .\u2019\n\u201cYou forgot thou, thee, thy, thine, and ye.\u201d\n\u201cYe has been canceled. Kanye West is officially over.\u201d\n\u201cMy God, who thought getting a card would be so difficult.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt because you are obviously retarded only in the exact clinical definition of the term. And we don\u2019t want to use the term \n.\u201d\n\u201cYou are shitting me.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t shit you as you are quickly becoming my favorite turd.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but using the word \nisn\u2019t funny either.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the hell not? Because playing cards have kings and queens? And kings are always boys and queens are girls?\u201d\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re right. I hadn\u2019t thought to be offended at that, yet there is more. Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but there are no more girls. A spade is a pejorative name for melanin over abundant persons. Do I really have to explain all this?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love a club right now so I could\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCould what? Are you threatening all my selves with violence? I assure you, anythree of my personas would gladly open up a can of whoopass on you. Now here. Take this and go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a folded up piece of cardstock with glitter and typography expressing heartfelt sentiments along with an envelope for $5.95.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a card.\u201d\n\u201cIf you insist on using that term, I suppose it is.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what it says. \nThis is horrible. Do you have any others?\u201d\n\u201cTry this one.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn't a card! This is a Chinese takeout menu.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate your cultural appropriation. Just open it up.\u201d\n\u201c\n I just want a Valentine\u2019s Day card, not to atone for Western civilization!\u201d\n\u201cJust doing my job, ma\u2019amsirthem.\u201d\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll take the first one. I talked to my mailman, and he assured me if I got it in the mail today it would be there by Valentine\u2019s day.\u201d\n\u201cThe \nwill get it in the \n? Have you not learned a thing? Were you even listening?\u201d\n\u201cAs little as I possibly could. What new rule did I break now?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to get it to your person-person so they can get in the person.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever to you, too. Have a non-specific day and thank you for shopping at Hallmark.\u201d\n "}
{"title": "Endy Mendy", "story": "What if I told you there was a demon devoted to the broken hearted?\n \nWhat if I told you that this isn't some fairy tale with monsters and villains, but a very real, breathing creation that is as old as time itself? This creature's sole existence revolves around targeting the broken-hearted, and trying in his own twisted way to mend them.\n \nHe only targets adults and leaves children well alone. He has no business cavorting with the realm of childish creations. This creature visits nearly all adults and leaves his mark on them.\n \nThis creature's name, is Endy Mendy.\n \nEndy Mendy is a demon, let me tell you that much. He targets the broken-hearted and heals them in his own depraved way.\n \nEndy Mendy slips into your room late at night and waits for you to fall asleep. That fleeting shape you see out of the corner of your eye? It's probably just the shadow of a branch outside and nothing more.\n \nEndy Mendy is much more terrifying, because he's invisible. He stands beside your bed, tall and hunched, waiting patiently. You may feel a faint breath on your cheek as you fall asleep. He does get rather close in anticipation.\n \nOnce you're asleep, Endy Mendy delves his talons deep into your chest and squeezes your heart with glee. Ever feel your heart rate fleetingly jump as you drift into sleep? It's him, and he's squeezing.\n \nEndy Mendy squeezes your heart until it shatters into a thousand pieces. Because you're asleep, you won't feel a thing. Sleep numbs your heart, it acts as a merciful anaesthetic.\n \nOnce your heart has been shattered, Endy Mendy hunches over you and gets to work, salivating excitedly as he does so.\n \nYou know that small wet patch on your pillow when you wake up? It's not your drool.\n \nOnce your heart has been shattered, Endy Mendy remakes it carefully, working late through the night. He pieces the shards of your heart together like an intricate puzzle, spit-shining the memories that cause you pain, so you never forget about them, for he believes remembering pain will help you avoid it in the future.\n \nOnce your heart is pieced together again, he identifies the piece that lets you love- the purest most shiny part of your heart. And he steals it.\n \nYou wake up in the morning and may feel a little groggy- it's natural after having your entire heart shattered and remade. You'll notice yourself becoming bitter and jaded as the days roll on, your smile becoming a wispy memory, your favourite colours diluted to dull puddles of indifference.\n \nIn Endy Mendy's eyes, he has healed you, for when you're bitter it's impossible for your heart to truly love someone, and no love means no further heartbreak.\n \nEndy Mendy leaves you with the most vital part of your heart missing, with a small hole left in its place. That hole, will steadily haemorrhage the very fuel your heart runs on- hope.\n \nSo why steal the crucial shard of your heart that helps you love? Well, Endy Mendy keeps that shard of your heart and melts it down. He then uses the liquid as ink, to write letters to a certain someone.\n \nYou see, Endy Mendy is broken hearted himself, having been spurned a long time ago by a woman who scorned his very existence.\n \nThe poor creature does not know how to love, so tries to sway her by frantically writing in the heart-ink of others, and sending these as desperate gifts to her every night. The woman he yearns after, is named Shadow-Lust.\n \nShadow-Lust was born of the evil things that men do in the dark. One day, that very darkness and the smirk of a lying politician melded together in union and discovered they understood each other in twisted and quaint ways.\n \nBefore long, Shadow-Lust was born, and was promptly hurled into the night, where she scarpered from corner to corner, searching frantically for her parents and stumbling every other step, for she was born with dark coals for eyes.\n \nEndy Mendy bumped into Shadow-Lust and was enamoured with her instantly. But being a demon, he couldn't express this love, so she spurned him, leaving him distraught and angry.\n \nThis is why Endy Mendy needs that piece of your heart, for he cannot understand love himself. A strong heart will repel him instantly, but someone who is broken-hearted is the perfect victim for the demon known as Endy Mendy.\n \nBut back to you. Endy Mendy leaving a hole in your heart isn't the end, stranger. You see, the heart has an amazing ability after heartbreak.\n \nIt can regenerate.\n \nHowever, you can only start the regenerating process once you accept that you are broken, and that Endy Mendy has meddled with your heart. It's upsetting to realise, but it's a necessary step before you can begin the healing process.\n \nThe missing shard will be remade from the experience you harbour, meaning your heart can never be shattered in that exact way ever again. It may take months or even years, but your heart's natural instinct is to heal itself, but only if you let it get on with its job.\n \nA heart that is broken, that is vulnerable and in pain, is like a delectable feast for Endy Mendy. Sometimes, before he visits the broken-hearted by their bedside, he'll jump on their back and wrap his spindly arms around them, in a twisted sort of embrace. Ever notice when you're heart-broken you'll sometimes feel leaden-heavy and tired? You might want to shake around a bit, for Endy Mendy has probably hitched a ride.\n \nBefore I leave, let me impart some knowledge that will save you from ever dealing with Endy Mendy and his talons.\n \nThe one thing that Endy Mendy cannot be in the same room as, let alone touch, is a heart that loves itself. It emits a pulse so strong it makes his eyeballs rove in their sockets, and he scarpers into the darkness, never to be seen again, snarling and snapping over his shoulder.\n \nA heart that loves itself understands heartbreak is a natural part of life, and allows itself to feel pain and sadness, for they are the forgotten siblings of ecstasy and joy.\n \nSo protect your heart, stranger. Beware of Endy Mendy and his twisted talons.\n "}
{"title": "Nutella, it's not for you", "story": "\"This is the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. Taste it! I wish they had it in the Czech Republic,\" Stella sighed. Thomas took a swallow.\n \n400,000 tons of Nutella. That's the amount of hazelnut cream consumed by humans to this day, with a lot of help from those who are no longer with us. That's approximately 24,242 Czech Tatra 815 trucks fully loaded with the thick sweet paste. If you lined them up in a row, you'd have to circle the globe four times to see them all. And Thomas thought he could literally see his girlfriend, Stella, consuming an entire truck.\n \n\"Sorry, I can't yet,\" Stella said a second after he heard the door to their apartment slam. Without giving him the slightest glance, she threw off her coat, pulled her battered laptop out of her bag, and ran to the kitchen table. He sighed in annoyance.\n\"Tough day at work?\"\n\"Not really. I just need to finish one article, pick out some photos and then I'll get right back to you,\" she responded. She managed to overlook the flowers he'd bought her on her lunch break, the new shirt he'd gotten for the occasion to make him look better, and the fact that the apartment was all cleaned up. Soon there was the familiar sound of fingers drumming hard on the keyboard, flowing to the rhythm of a partly manic and partly completely unnecessary fear that if she didn't get the article in on time, the whole world would collapse. As Thomas saw it, the only thing showing signs of collapse at that moment was Stella.\n\"I think I'll go to bed now,\" he said, hoping that Stella would understand from the tone of his announcement that the workday was over for him. He went to his bedroom, where, with a typical stubbornness that is not to be shown in today's world, he pulled off his shirt and pulled back on his favourite T-shirt that he slept in every night and in which he had secretly spent the whole day.\n\"Good night,\" he said, still in the kitchen doorway, as he watched Stella shovel in another kilo of Nutella. That's only one kilo out of the 400 million she would have to eat to equal the whole of humanity, he thought with relief, and went to sleep.\n \nValentine's Day was five days away.\nHe was awakened by the sound of Stella's door slamming as she left for work. As usual, he didn't get up early enough for them to have a few words to exchange. With each such slam, he got out of bed as if someone had just raised the alarm on the street. Reeling from the shock he couldn't face, he staggered to the bathroom, brushed his teeth, pulled on his pants and went to work.\n \n\"Where are you taking that girl of yours tomorrow?\" echoed his co-worker jovially, to whom the holiday of love made perfect sense and who never dared to question the significance of the chocolates and half wilted flowers he fought over every year in crowded malls with a legion of other men. They all believed that it was the very least thing they could do for their halves, and the strength of the shared belief ultimately proved them right every February. Those who didn't buy into it had to face a few uncomfortable minutes of explaining to others that they didn't believe in Valentine's Day, or that it was a completely consumerist holiday that they refused to participate in. \"We're going to this new place that just opened around the corner. That's a holiday today, isn't it?\" a colleague gushed. Thomas felt like punching him right there and then. Instead, he turned his face towards another colleague, who was bored watching a review of the new games that would soon be released on the Playstation.\n \nIn the evening, a familiar scene awaited him at home. Stella, still in her work clothes and with her mascara slightly smudged, reinforcing the dark shadow under her eyes, sat at the kitchen table tapping out more words on her computer. He had come home later than usual, arousing her curiosity.\n\"Where are you coming from?\"\n\"From work.\"\n\"This late?\" She grumbled.\n\"I figured you'd probably still be working, so I did some extra work,\" he explained to her. Stella mumbled something vaguely, then said:\n\"I need to rest.\"\n\"Really?\" He asked. \"Come on, I'll read you something from the book I'm reading,\" Thomas offered her.\n\"Oh no, no reading at all. After all, I consume and create content from morning to night,\" Stella said, continuing to write as if no dialogue had taken place. A second later, she got up and ran to the pantry for more Nutella. And that's when it clicked for him.\nThis time they would celebrate the holiday of love together like never. \u00a0\n \nThe sun was beating down on them so hard that they could hardly keep their bodies upright. Thomas was getting tired and would have liked to stick his head in the sand if only it wasn't so hot. Stella, however, seemed to be content. There was no sign on her dark skin that the hot sun's rays could harm her in any way. She laid with her eyelids closed on the blanket, which was covered with grains of sand, while Thomas repeatedly slathered his white arms with sunscreen and gazed longingly at the surface of the water until it finally turned pink.\n \nHe didn't enjoy it much. But he was glad that Stella was finally resting. She loved the sea, and after years of denial, for which she could blame the randomness of fate, which had not bestowed wealth on either of them, he could finally take her to the shores of Italy. Stella could lie on the beach all day and boredom did not come upon her. He envied her for it and looked forward himself to the day giving way to night, and them finally replacing the natural solarium with a nice warm breeze and stone sidewalks to keep them pleasantly cool while they sipped wine in one of the overpriced restaurants.\n \nThe sun was beating down on them so hard that they could hardly keep their bodies upright.

Stella stretched her arms behind her head and purred like a cat that had just decided to wake up from a sleep that was none of people's business. She felt her eyelids flutter open in a complicated way; the red darkness replaced by a harsh light they rarely experienced at home. She looked at him and said, \"You want to be somewhere else now, don't you?\"\n\"Why can't you relax at home like this?\" He shot out and stopped himself. She stiffened.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Why don't you relax like this normally? Why do you have to work all the time?\" he finished the thought.\n\"Because you work too little. Come on, let's go get some ice cream, at least you'll get a break from the sun for a while,\" she suggested.\nAt that moment, he pouted like a cat.\n \nShe ordered a hazelnut flavoured ice cream. He watched her lick the first layer of the runny substance with her tongue, and with each successive lick, he could feel the anger building inside him. So, he wasn't working enough? If he worked so little, they wouldn't even be here, he thought angrily in his mind. A scooter drove past them, and Thomas wished for nothing more than to knock its driver to the ground, grab the bike, drive to the other side of Italy and drink himself into a stupor. Instead, he continued to watch his girlfriend dangerously dispose of an enormous portion of the sweet icy substance.\nHe was about to take a breath to tell her everything he'd ever missed when suddenly Stella said, \"Thanks for bringing me here. It's great here, and this ice cream tastes like Nutella, but it's even a little better, you know? It tastes like the rest I haven't had in a thousand years.\"\n \nAbout three quarters of a year later, he stood in the kitchen doorway and watched Stella with suppressed enthusiasm as she slammed down another glass of Nutella. This time he felt he had found a surprise that would pull Stella out of her daily stress and overwhelmed state. A surprise with a story behind it far more powerful than the one Stella taps into her computer daily to satisfy the dubious fantasies of her superiors.\n \nWith one day left until Valentine's Day, he left Stella in her anxiety, laid in bed, and looked for a place in Prague to get ice cream with the same exact flavour that had managed to stop Stella for a fleeting moment.\n \nHe found out a lot of interesting things about it. Gianduja, as Stella's ice cream flavour was called, refers to a sweet chocolate spread that contains about 30% hazelnut paste. It was invented in Turin in the 18th century during Napoleon's regency. At the time, Europe was governed by the Continental System, introduced by Napoleon in 1806, which prevented British goods from entering European ports under French control. The result was a shortage of cocoa supplies. The Turin chocolatier Michele Prochet therefore mixed the little chocolate he had with hazelnuts from the Langhe hills south of Turin. Some historical sources consider it to be the basis of today's Nutella.\n \nBut Thomas couldn't find any ice cream parlours serving the same flavour in Bohemia. So, when he came home from work on February 14, he took off his shirt and pants, pulled on his pyjamas and headed straight to bed.\n \nHe was awakened only by the sound of a spoon dropped on the floor a few hours later by Stella as she was taking another empty Nutella jar to the sink."}
{"title": "The Golden Teapot", "story": "Egret and Heron sat at opposite sides of the small table in the parlor of their castle.\u00a0In the center of the table sat a gleaming silver tea set consisting of a pot with more curves than their mother, two cups with fancy scrolled handles, saucers, a creamer with tiny lion\u2019s feet, and a sugar bowl. The noon sun\u2019s rays plunged through the tall, multi-paned windows and dazzling white reflections from every shiny surface buffeted round the room like a light-filled kaleidoscope.\nThe handle of the sugar spoon was an eagle with a garnet eye. The merlot-colored gemstone flashed crimson, emulating the fire in the girls\u2019 eyes as they glared at each other with tight, grim lips.\nEgret, who was ten, at last broke the silence and said, \u201cTry a scone dear sister.\u00a0I helped Miss Dorothy make them just this morning.\u201d Her eyes widened to parodies of innocence.\nHeron, who was nine, said, \u201cNo thank you dearest Egret.\u00a0I do not care for scones.\u201d\u00a0At nine, she was a twin reflection of her sister.\u00a0She willed her own doe-like eyes to remain carefree.\u00a0She used to like scones quite a lot, especially the ones with small bittersweet chips of chocolate in them, like the ones taunting her from the table.\u00a0The week before, she\u2019d been halfway through eating one when a foul taste in her mouth made her gag.\u00a0\nEgret had fallen to the floor in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.\u00a0Between her annoying giggles she\u2019d said, \u201cNot all small brown chips are always chocolate.\u201d\nTheir mother was sick to death of their sibling rivalry, when Egret had snitched, she\u2019d said, \u201cYou are sisters.\u00a0You should be best friends.\u00a0These negative feelings between you two are wasting precious moments you\u2019ll never have again.\u201d\nHeron hated to see her mother so distressed, it made her guts curl and shrivel up like a dying snake on the end of an iron stake.\u00a0She tried to be good but inevitably found herself playing pranks to get even.\u00a0\nAs footsteps approached the parlor door, Heron patted the pinned-up braids in her deep auburn hair, checked her fingernails again, and smoothed the pale green silk of her simple gown.\u00a0Egret did likewise, like a mirror image except her\u2019s was a gown of magenta, with sparkling beads and emerald embroidery.\u00a0Egret liked fancy things.\u00a0Heron would have preferred squire\u2019s britches and poet blouses.\u00a0Under her long skirt she wore tan leather riding boots and now she made sure they were tucked completely underneath.\u00a0Naturally, her sister crossed her legs and a bright pink satin slipper bobbed coquettishly, the gems and sequins flashing in the sunlight.\nTheir mother swooped into the parlor in a regal swirl of cream-colored silk.\u00a0Her dark hair flowed freely down her back, pinned up at the sides with topaz hair clips.\u00a0Heron\u2019s palms dampened and her scalp itched fiercely, as if turned to a nest of fire ants.\u00a0She should have known Mother would come to tea.\u00a0Since last week\u2019s horrendous prank, she\u2019d been checking in on her wayward daughters more frequently.\u00a0\nEvenline D\u2019Amoressy sat gracefully on a shantung covered seat between them.\u00a0\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to see you two properly honoring the Balmoral Circle Ceremony.\u00a0With no teasing and shrieking and what-not.\u201d\nQueen D\u2019Amoressy pulled Egret\u2019s cup to her place setting and eyed the scones suspiciously.\u00a0Egret said, \u201cThe scones are fine.\u00a0I\u2019ve been good and proper all week Mother.\u201d\n\u201cPour \n a cup and let\u2019s enjoy each other\u2019s company.\u201d\nHeron willed a calm voice and said, \u201cMother, wouldn\u2019t you like my cup instead?\u00a0Mine is hotter.\u201d\n\u201cSweetheart, you know to pass to the left when a new guest sits at the table.\u201d\nEgret reached to the tea cart, daintily chose another cup, and positioned it in place with the handle facing right.\u00a0It was her turn to host, so she offered the cream and sugar counterclockwise, first to her sister, then to her mother.\u00a0\nWhen it was apparent that her mother intended to stay for the duration of the tea ceremony, Heron feigned illness.\nWith pinkie out, Evenline sipped then said, \u201cThere is nothing better for an upset tummy than a nice Earl Grey\u201d.\u00a0\nAfter fifteen minutes, she sipped again.\u00a0Then frowned.\u00a0She studied the remaining liquid in her cup.\u00a0She gagged, stood hastily, and ran from the room with a hand over her mouth.\nEgret looked into the cup and grinned.\u00a0\u201cOhhhhhh\u2026you\u2019re in big trouble now!\u201d\nIn the bottom of the cup was a fat brown Pukebug.\nLater that evening, when Queen D\u2019Amoressy felt no more waves of nausea, she summoned her daughters and got to the truth.\u00a0Heron had attempted retaliation for the scone incident after promising no more pranks.\u00a0\n\u201cAs punishment, I am sending you to Grebelda\u2019s tower. You will remain there until your father comes home.\u201d The girls sucked in breath.\u00a0\u201cEgret, stop gloating, it\u2019s unbecoming of a princess.\u201d\nHeron said, \u201cBut Auntie Greb is crazy and\u2026and\u2026Father\u2026\u201d\nEveline silenced her with the look of a coiled viper and the unfinished lament buzzed in the room like a deadly excreta fly.\u00a0Had Heron finished her plea, it would have been, \u2018\u2026\nThe queen said, \u201cIt is true Greb is a tad bit eccentric.\u00a0But she is world traveled and the one who brought us the Balmoral Circle Tea Ceremony, all the way from far eastern Xaxang.\u00a0You went too far this afternoon, young lady, and poisoned the actual \n itself.\u00a0Shame on you. Greb will teach you to respect the ceremony.\u201d\nIn the top of the highest tower, Heron sat across from a very old woman.\u00a0Greb passed a tray of lemon bars to her left as Heron passed the sugar to \n left.\u00a0Greb stirred the tea to make sure it had steeped to just the right rich amber color.\u00a0Her bony wrist a stark white contrast to the soft woven black gown she favored.\u00a0The worn ivory lace of her undershift ruffled from her neckline.\u00a0Heron wore a long green velvet vest over her chemise and dark tights.\u00a0At least she was more comfortable and did not have to hide her old tan boots. She wore her auburn tresses loose like her mother.\n\u201cYou are the spitting image of Evenline!\u201d Declared Greb.\u00a0\u201cAlthough she\u2019d never be caught dead in a man\u2019s britches.\u00a0Ho ho hoooo!\u201d\n\u201cI am so happy to be allowed to be me. I always assumed you were sent here by Father because you were insane, but now I think I understand that you \n to live up here.\u00a0It\u2019s peaceful here, and lovely\u2026no rot, no filth, no angst, no fear\u2026\u201d\nShe turned to the tall tea service cabinet in the wall by the ten-foot west window.\u00a0It was built into the stone wall and held a shelf of four beautiful tea pots, two were of fine China, two were of silver.\u00a0The shelf below it held sixteen cups and sixteen saucers.\u00a0On the bottom shelf were assorted serving dishes, plates, creamers, and sugar bowls.\u00a0High above Heron\u2019s head was the top shelf which seemed empty.\u00a0\nOn Heron\u2019s tenth birthday, tea was served at four.\u00a0\u00a0At four, the sun came into the tower parlor window sideways.\u00a0Something glowed like amber fire on the top shelf, just out of sight.\nGreb put an assortment of special treats on the table and asked Heron to choose her favorite teapot and settings.\u00a0She turned around in time to see Heron pull down a golden teapot, glowing like a lantern in the sun.\u00a0\u201cOh, Auntie Greb\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop! Don\u2019t touch that thing!\u201d\nHeron jumped and the golden teapot flew from her fingers like a chicken escaping the chopping block.\u00a0Grebelda wasn\u2019t ninety anymore, but twenty, as she caught the teapot deftly, and, holding only the spout and edge of its ornately scrolled handle, she placed it on the bottom ledge.\nShaking, Heron said, \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0It\u2019s so \n\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also very dangerous.\u00a0Never, NEVER touch it again.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\nGrebelda silenced her with a withering look.\u00a0She pulled a chair over and put the forbidden teapot back on the top shelf, pushing it until it touched the back wall.\nThey finished setting the table in silence.\n\u201cLong life and sweet tea.\u00a0And a very happy birthday to you.\u201d\u00a0The old woman said.\n\u201cLong life and sweet tea, Auntie.\u201d\nThey sipped.\n\u201cYou were only half correct when you surmised my reasons for living up here.\u00a0The other reason I do so is to protect the entity of the teapot.\u00a0It must never, EVER fall into the wrong hands.\u00a0Unleashed, it is a force of fury so great, all in its way is destroyed.\u00a0Never, EVER caress the belly of the pot.\u00a0To look upon its golden surface is to be possessed, the pot will sing to you the sweetest lullaby.\u00a0Your mind will be lost if you listen long enough.\u201d\nHeron looked up to the top shelf.\u00a0The sun\u2019s rays had moved on and had taken the magical glow with it.\u00a0Grebelda smacked the table for her attention, the sound like a pistol shot.\u00a0\u201cHave a chocolate macaroon, they were your favorite when you were little.\u201d\nHeron accepted.\u00a0She didn\u2019t look to the top shelf again but late that night, in her bed, the teapot did indeed sing to her.\nAnd continued to beckon to her every night thereafter.\u00a0Its voice was melodic, soft, yet reassuring\u2026\u201d Free me my love\u201d it sang.\u00a0\u201cI will save you if you save me,\u201d it sang.\u00a0She had no idea what that meant.\nThe pleasant days flew by, the end of summer brought wild banshee hurricanes.\u00a0High in the tower she watched people flee for cover, hanging on to what little they possessed. She watched the yard turn from soupy brown muck to a roiling brown lake.\nHeron read and studied and practiced her shot with her longbow and arrows, taking aim at inanimate objects- carts, trees, wagons.\nThrough every season, every night, the teapot sang its beckoning song.\u00a0It had become a lullaby that sweetened her dreams with imaginings of its singer.\u00a0She pictured a tall, broad-shouldered prince on a magnificent shiny black steed.\u00a0He\u2019d have peridot green eyes and dark curly hair.\nOn the last day of spring, a thunder of hoofbeats arose and found the tower window.\u00a0Heron rushed to it.\u00a0\u201cFather!\u201d\u00a0\n!\n\u201cGo on child.\u00a0Go welcome your father.\u201d Her aunt was smiling, but sadness tinged her eyes darkly.\nOut on the field, Egret and her mother were helping her father off his mount.\u00a0The horse was near collapsing, a stable-hand led the weary beast away.\u00a0The other knights were dismounting, and Heron counted only twenty of them.\u00a0There had been two thousand the year before.\u00a0She ran to her father who was falling heavily against Evenline.\u00a0Two of their manservants unburdened the queen before she toppled under the weight.\u00a0The king\u2019s body oozed thick, gooey blood from too many perforations.\u00a0His chainmail hung like swampmoss from his stooped, shrunken body.\u00a0Blood pattered to the dirt.\nThe queen shouted to her, \u201cGo boil some water!\u00a0Fill the tub!\u00a0Have Donny fetch the surgeon!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here my queen,\u201d said an old man in a long deep blue robe, his soft white beard wafting in the chilly wind as he spoke.\u00a0\nHeron saw the fear in his eyes and braced herself for the inevitable.\u00a0Egret was a statue with streams flowing from her eyes.\u00a0Her hair had come undone, and her pale dress was soaked with blood.\u00a0\nHeron touched her sister\u2019s arm and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back.\u00a0He\u2019s---\u201d\n\u201cOh shut up!\u00a0What do \n know?!\u201d Egret whirled and strode off, followed by a young handsome knight.\u00a0Heron followed slowly, tears falling from her hanging head.\nIn the castle, she sat in the masculine parlor outside her father\u2019s closed door.\u00a0Her mother came and put her arms around her.\u00a0She softly said, \u201cWelcome home darling.\u201d\nHeron hugged her mother.\u00a0The queen stood again and turned towards the closed door.\u00a0She frowned at Heron and said, \u201cWhat in Peta\u2019s name are you wearing?\u00a0You look like a boy.\u201d\nEgret barked a laugh.\nThe queen shook her head and mumbled, \u201cNevermind.\u00a0We\u2019ll discuss your homecoming later.\u201d She went to the door, and just as she was about to lever the handle, it opened, and a tall figure in blue slowly shook his white bearded head.\u00a0Evenline squawked like gut-shot goose and ran into the room.\u00a0The surgeon closed the door behind her.\u00a0Though the door was two inches thick, Evenline\u2019s wails reverberated in the gloomy parlor like a loon\u2019s cry on a lonely lake.\nHeron slipped out from the castle unnoticed and climbed the tower stairs as fast as she could, the pounding in her heart overtook her booted footfalls.\u00a0At the top, she nearly collapsed from exertion, her breath escaped her lungs like cannon-fire.\nHer aunt was fastening a soft, long cloak around her bony shoulders.\u00a0She was not surprised in the least to see Heron back.\u00a0\nHeron, still panting, said, \u201cFather\u2019s dead.\u201d\nGrebelda nodded.\u00a0\u201cYes. Stay here in the tower, you will be safe.\u00a0There\u2019s a black storm coming.\u00a0Reginald only lived long enough to warn us.\u201d\nBefore she could enquire about any of the mystical vocalizations, Grebelda was gone.\nShe never returned.\nAt dawn, Heron awoke from a dazed, not-quite-sleep, to the sounds of battle cries.\u00a0\nShe looked out the window.\u00a0The fields to the north were black with soldiers like thousands of chitinous- coated ants. The wind changed direction and she heard the hoofbeats and clanging of armor and weaponry.\u00a0\nThe tower servant was bringing her more arrows, she could see him in the yard, prying the old arrows from wagons and carts.\u00a0Her father\u2019s army had been decimated.\u00a0There was no hope.\u00a0\nThe guards at the gate were bowled over like tin soldiers when the iron-fisted battering column broke through.\u00a0The soldiers in black swept through the yard like a plague, indiscriminate and blood thirsty.\u00a0She saw their faces smiling and laughing \u2013 their enemy was dead; the castle was theirs.\u00a0\nHeron pulled the bowstring surely, her left arm a solid mast, and the laughing face of a Satan\u2019s minion split in the forehead, under the force of her specialized dragonstone arrowhead.\u00a0She wasted no time between firing and did so like a machine.\u00a0Her aim was true and after fourteen kills, she\u2019d been discovered.\nBlack Satan\u2019s spawns surged towards the tower.\u00a0She looked straight down and saw that six-foot building stones had been piled against the only entrance.\u00a0\n.\u2019\u00a0She continued slaying the attackers, ignoring all thoughts of her family, for they were surely gone.\u00a0\u2018\nShe watched as the servant boy\u2019s body was trampled to rust-brown paste at the stones.  She swallowed back down the bile-like cry.\u00a0She had forty arrows left and needed a clear head to make each one count. \nAnd they did.\u00a0Useless as it was.\u00a0Throughout the night, after she\u2019d run out of arrows, she\u2019d only been able to watch in horror as everything turned to blood and ash.\u00a0Eventually, she knew they\u2019d come for her.\u00a0In the safety of her tower, she gave in to fatigue.\u00a0All she could do was take each minute at a time, as hopeless as those minutes seemed.\nShe slept against the windowsill.\u00a0As always, the handsome prince\u2019s lullaby swept deliciously through her head.\u00a0In her dreams of him she said, \u201cI must leave you now my prince.\u00a0I am surely doomed, death awaits me by the morn\u2019s lonely path.\u201d\nThe lullaby turned to a violent barrage of an opera singer\u2019s baritone voice so powerful it reverberated in the stone walls.\u00a0Heron was alarmed to find she was not dreaming but fully awake, yet the voice of the teapot raged.\u00a0It said the same things as always, \u201cI will save you if you save me!\u201d\nShe ran to the tea cupboard, dragged a chair over, and stood with arms outstretched.\u00a0She felt the teapot and brushed it closer with her fingers.\u00a0She pulled it out with a hand on the spout and the other on the handle.\u00a0Moonlight caught the golden surface as she descended the chair.\u00a0At the table she placed both hands alongside the teapot.\u00a0It should have been cool to the touch but was warm as if filled with hot tea.\u00a0She held the teapot in both hands to her body, caressing its silken warmth.\nThe air inside the tower whirled like a golden dust-storm.\u00a0It poured from the spout in glittering mica whorls, and she couldn\u2019t breathe.\u00a0Around the glittering, tornado swirls, the voice she\u2019d heard for a year laughed. She wasn\u2019t afraid.\u00a0Why should she be?\u00a0She was to die at the dawn of the next day.\nHeron whirled around the room, dancing her last dance with her fantasy prince.\u00a0\nThe golden dust settled, and she saw it was not actually a prince that had sang to her, but a freaking, incredible\u2026 golden dragon!\nThe golden dragon was twelve feet tall with leathery wings tucked against its body.\u00a0He did have peridot green eyes however, and said, \u201cIt is dawn.\u00a0You saved me. I save you.\u201d He lowered his scaly, golden body down and she climbed up between his wings.\nThe dragon said, \u201cI\u2019m Harold by the way.\u201d As he swooped from the window over the decimated courtyard.\u00a0Everyone in the yard was burnt to a crisp as well as anyone dumb enough to run out of the castle itself.\nTHE END\nFor now\u2026"}
{"title": "Cat in a Candy Store", "story": "Pepper peeked out from under the counter and groaned as he spied the woman setting up the Hallmark display with heart adorned cards. \n\u2018\n\u2019\u00a0The woman was Candace and she owned Candy\u2019s Sweet Shoppe.\u00a0Pepper the rat\u2019s ash grey fur puffed and his white whiskers bristled uncontrollably.\u00a0They did that when he was annoyed.\nPepper scurried across the pink linoleum beneath the counter, across the floor to under the shelves.\u00a0From there he was able to see the calendar on the wall. \n.\u2019\u00a0He dramatically held a pink paw to his forehead.\u00a0\n \u00a0\nA flash of white caught his eye just outside the door.\u00a0\n.\u2019\u00a0She was the shop cat that lived in the bookstore across the cobblestoned street.\u00a0He watched as she slinked over it gracefully.\u00a0She patiently waited at the bookshop\u2019s door until it was opened.\u00a0The fingers of a small pale hand curled around the doorframe like starfish legs clinging to a rock and pulled it shut.\u00a0It was the hand of the young boy who helped the man run the store.\u00a0The man could only be the boy\u2019s father- same shaggy dark hair, same wideset brown eyes, same animated way they flapped their hands when they talked.\nPepper daydreamed.\u00a0He would have killed for a boy of his own.\u00a0He suddenly felt exposed and looked behind him.\u00a0Candace came around the counter towards the shelves with an armload of heartsy, cutesy, stuffed animals.\u00a0She was wearing her readers down low on her freckled nose, her hair a frothy red mop pinned up by butterfly barrettes.\u00a0Her blue eyes peered over the eyeglass frames and grew huge and round when she spied Pepper.\u00a0\nWoman and rat froze.\u00a0\nThen Candace broke her paralysis and screamed like a factory steam whistle at days end.\u00a0Simultaneously, she threw the small, plush animals into the air.\u00a0They plopped and bounced all around Pepper- puppies, kittens, a fluffy green alligator, a ladybug bonked Pepper\u2019s noggin.\u00a0He shook his head, zig-zagged through the stuffed toy fallout (noting that there were no rat toys) and zipped across the floor to his little hole underneath the counter where he lived.\n \n \n \nThe next day Candace brought a cat to the candy store.\nHe was an orange tabby with deep pumpkin-colored stripes, the same shade as Candace\u2019s soft plentitude of curls.\n\u201cHere you go Killer,\u201d said Candace as she lowered a small bowl of milk to the floor.\u00a0She placed it next to the counter and as the cat lapped lazily it purred.\u00a0It looked up, white droplets pattered off its whiskers, the purring ceased.\u00a0It sniffed at the hole and growled like a miniature tiger.\nKiller crouched with ears perked forward, staring into the hole.\u00a0\nAt last, two hours later, it got up and padded to the front door.\u00a0He sat and his head traveled from left to right slowly.\u00a0Curious, Pepper skittered to the bookshelves, Killer\u2019s whiskers twitched at the faint ticking noises made by the rat\u2019s tiny claws.\u00a0But he didn\u2019t turn around.\u00a0He was mesmerized by the sleek white feline slinking down the sidewalk across the street.\nWhen the bookstore door opened, and Fredrica went inside the darkened doorway, Killer snapped out of it and turned around.\u00a0Pepper ran under the shelves, darted under the counter, and he couldn\u2019t help squealing with fright as he felt the ground behind him pound with heavy cat feet in hot pursuit.\u00a0\nHe made it to safety.\u00a0But he felt like he was having a heart attack.\u00a0The orange tabby was fast, the floor was slick, and the cat whumped into the counter, rattling the sliding glass doors in the back.\u00a0\nThe cat paced the length of the front counter.\u00a0Pepper had an idea.\u00a0He raced back to the shelves.\u00a0Killer heard the tippy-tapping and hurried after the sneaky rat.\u00a0Pepper crawled up the back of the shelving and came out on the third shelf.\u00a0The cat leapt to the shelf and swiped at the rat who ducked out of reach.\u00a0Killer knocked three stuffed toys to the ground.\u00a0Then three more.\u00a0After a pile of books clattered down, Heels clicked on the floor from the office in the back.\n\u201cKiller!\u00a0What on earth?\u00a0What \n you done?\u201d Candace\u2019s voice was shrilly as she took in the mess.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to kill the rat.\u00a0Not destroy the store.\u00a0Grrrr.\u201d\nPepper giggled as he climbed to the top shelf.\u00a0He had a stash of candy up there and was safely out of reach.\nAfter dark, Candace closed the shop for the day.\u00a0She put a plate of sardines by the milk bowl and turned the lights off on her way out the door.\nKiller stopped scarfing up the fish and looked towards the sound.\u00a0He frowned at the package of gummy bears lying on the floor in front of the door.\u00a0His eyes grew soft and glistening as he caught the glow of white fur across the street.\u00a0He went to the window in the door and stared as the lovely feline licked her paws and cleaned her face.\n\u2019 tiny footfalls.\nKiller turned as the long, leathery rat tail disappeared under the shelves.\u00a0He went to his dinner.\u00a0The plate was licked clean.\u00a0\u201cMeeeeeooooooowwwwrrrr!\u201d He howled in frustration.\n \n \nThe next day when Candace was occupied in the office, Pepper scurried like an ash being blown across the floor.\u00a0Killer chased after.\u00a0The rat squiggled under the metal revolving card rack then under the counter.\u00a0The cat slid over the polished pink floor and straight into the rack.\u00a0It toppled over in a jangling, twanging, pile of metal rods and crumpled cards.\n\u201cOh come on!\u201d \nKiller slunk to the corner, head hung low, he looked like a sad orange gargoyle.\nCandace sighed and said, \u201cI thought you were a mouser\u2026er\u2026ratter?\u00a0You\u2019re more trouble than the rat!\u201d\n \n \n \nThat night Candace left a plate of mackerel for the cat who had sulked in the corner behind the counter all day.\n\u2018\n.\u2019\nKiller padded silently on orange pom-pom feet to the door.\u00a0He sat next to the colorful package of sour worms and watched the white cat at the bookstore.\nWithout turning around, Killer said, \u201cHelp yourself.\u00a0I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\nPepper looked up, surprised, his eyes glittered like black beads as they caught the dim streetlight outside.\u00a0His cheeks were full like fat, fuzzy grey walnuts; he swallowed, \n, and studied the cat.\n\u201cAnd why would I want to eat you anyways?\u00a0I like fish.\u00a0And chicken\u2026turkey\u2019s good too.\u00a0Not rat.\u00a0Yuck.\u00a0Fur and whiskers and teeth?\u00a0Hmmf.\u201d The cat looked sideways towards the rat, as if he was keeping one eye on the rat and one on the white cat.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not messing with me?\u201d\nKiller shrugged.\u00a0\u201cMeh.\u201d\u00a0He turned towards the window again.\u00a0The angel was gone.\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Fredrica.\u00a0The boy calls her Freddy.\u201d\nKiller\u2019s ears perked up.\u00a0He said in a dreamy low voice, \u201cShe\u2019s sooo beautiful.\u201d \n\u201cSo ask her out.\u201d\u00a0\nKiller jumped when he realized the rat was sitting next to him.\u00a0He said, \u201cshe\u2019d never like an ole tom like me.\u201d\n\u201cWomen love wooing.\u00a0Cats are no different.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018woo?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDude, look around this place.\u00a0All this heartsy, cutesy crap,\u201d Pepper said, his mouth in a downward grimace.\u00a0He added, \u201cIt\u2019s pure commercial poop.\u00a0Humans spend boocoo bucks on it.\u00a0Especially now, it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s season.\u00a0Ugh.\u00a0I hate the color pink.\u00a0And all this foo-fooey stuff\u2026makes my eyeballs bleed.\u201d\nKiller was looking at the rat blankly, like the rat was giving a sermon on Greek or something.\u00a0The rat studied the cat\u2019s face and realized he\u2019d been ranting.\u00a0\nHe took a deep breath and said, \u201c\n can take advantage of it though.\u201d\nKiller looked dubious.\nPepper said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u00a0Let\u2019s make a deal.\u00a0I\u2019ll help you win Freddy\u2019s heart, and you don\u2019t slaughter me.\u201d\nThe cat said, \u201cbut if I don\u2019t kill you, Candace will toss me out for sure.\u201d\n\u201cAw heck.\u00a0I can find a new place.\u00a0I\u2019ve been eating candy all my life and am priii-teee sick of it.\u00a0I\u2019m more of a \u2018salty\u2019type.\u201d\nThe rat waited patiently for the cat to process what he was trying to tell him.\u00a0He could practically hear the rusty cogs and wheels turning in Killer\u2019s head.\u00a0After a minute, Killer smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re saying I can woo Fredrica with this Valentine\u2019s stuff?\u201d\nPepper said, \u201cChicks dig it.\u00a0They get all googly eyed and mooshy, even feline chicks.\u00a0Seen it a million times.\u201d\u00a0He suppressed a gag.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll start tomorrow. Now go eat your fish, you can have the rest.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d said the cat sarcastically, \u201cmy own dinner?\u00a0Gee thanks.\u201d\n\u201cThe omegas are great for a silky coat.\u201d\u00a0Pepper sat up and smoothed down his white belly.\n \n \n \nThe next day, Pepper was extra careful to stay out of sight.\u00a0Perhaps if the woman didn\u2019t see him, she\u2019d let up on Killer a bit.\u00a0That night, after the shop was closed, he came out and sat with Killer in the shadows under the shelves.\nKiller excitedly said, \u201cOh, here she comes.\u201d His orange fur bristled as if each strand was alive and ready to take off into orbit.\nPepper\u2019s own pulse perked up along with his ears.\u00a0He was having fun with this.\nFredrica\u2019s silky fur glowed bluey in the merry white light of the big moon.\u00a0They watched as the luminescent cat across the street approached the bouquet of flowers on the bookshop\u2019s doorstep.\u00a0They drooped a bit and a pale petal drifted to her feet as Fredrica picked them up and studied the pretty blooms.\u00a0Pepper had picked them from the brick sidewalk planter from the store next door and wrapped the stems in some of the candy shop\u2019s bright pink tissue paper.\u00a0She looked down both sides of the street, the boys sucked in breath as her eyes lingered on the candy shop\u2019s glass paned door.\u00a0Then her own door opened behind her a crack.\u00a0The cobblestoned street was more of an alley, it was in the boutiquey section of town only accessible to pedestrians.\u00a0From forty feet away they heard the young boy say, \u201cWhy Miss Freddy, ah do declare you have an admirer.\u201d\nPepper elbowed Killer and gave him a tiny thumbs up.\n \n \nThe next night, the cat and rat covertly watched as Frederica inspected the mini heart shaped box of chocolates on the doorstep.\u00a0Instead of chocolates, the rat had filled it with sardine heads and anchovy tails.\u00a0It had a pawprint on the red flocked top lid.\u00a0This time she looked around smiling, with a snow-white paw pressed to her chest.\n \n \n \nThe third night, the white cat came home to find a plush stuffed woodchuck with a little pink (of course) shirt that said on it, \u2018I\u2019d chop for you.\u2019\u00a0Killer had raised his brows at Pepper over that one.\nPepper only said, \u201cCorny. Yes.\u00a0But loveable to chicks.\u00a0Besides\u2026just watch\u201d\u00a0\nFredrica tossed the toy in the air, squealing with delight.\u00a0She hugged it and nuzzled it with her grinning cheeks.\nPepper said, \u201cthat\u2019s the catnip.\u201d\u00a0That morning Pepper had stuffed some of the dried leaves into it.\u00a0\nKiller had only raised his brows when Pepper had brought the cat contraband back early that morning.\u00a0He had said, \u201cwhere did you find it?\u201d\nPepper shrugged and said, \u201cI have my ways, my friend. I am a rat after all. \n\u201d\nNow, as Killer spied on the white cat, he waited for her to settle down.\u00a0Apparently, catnip was like \u2018cat pot\u2019.\u00a0Fredrica lay on her belly embracing the fuzzy toy.\u00a0Then she sat up and looked around, apparently, she\u2019d noticed something else.\u00a0\nKiller looked at Pepper expectantly.\u00a0Pepper grinned back.\u00a0Both friends looked out the window.\nFredrica had rolled over the card.\u00a0The clincher.\u00a0She picked it up and read it.\u00a0Then re-read it.\u00a0Her white fur glowed like an ice-covered glacial lake, she looked like a spectral wood nymph as she twirled in the moonlight. \nThe bookstore door opened, and the dark-haired boy came out and observed the cat\u2019s odd behavior.\u00a0He watched her as she pranced into the bookstore.\u00a0The boy looked around, but the narrow street was empty.\u00a0He shrugged then followed the cat inside.\nThe card, ironically, had been one off the metal rack that had caused Killer so much grief the week before.\u00a0It was goofy.\u00a0At least Pepper thought so, but he had convinced Killer that it would be the final \u2018Valentine\u2019\u2026like the cherry on the top of a sundae.\nBoth rat and cat had agreed that Killer should not actually sign his name. \u00a0That could only end up having her screaming and hiding in her closet the rest of her nine lives.\u00a0He left another pawprint and \u2018\n\u2019\n \nThe red-haired woman had not seen the rat for days.\u00a0She was so happy that she put a cat door in place of the bathroom window at the back of the shop.\u00a0Ten minutes before midnight, Killer went out it and sat on the step in front of Candy\u2019s Sweet Life.\u00a0Pepper hid in the brick planter fifteen feet away.\nAt exactly twelve, the white feline came around the corner from the top of the street.\u00a0She looked nervous; the tip of her tail twitched like the Queen\u2019s white-gloved wave.\u00a0Killer stood as she approached and said, \u201cHello Fredrica.\u00a0You look beautiful as always.\u00a0Um, my name\u2019s Killer.\u00a0Uh, not like in \u2018Lady\u2019 or \u2018Serial\u2019!\u00a0But---\u201d\nFredrica laughed.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u00a0Call me Freddy.\u00a0Hey, you wanna come over for some warm milk?\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing I would rather do.\u201d\u00a0Killer looked towards the planter where Pepper watched.\u00a0He walked past him towards the bookstore.\u00a0He gave the rat a thumbs up.\nPepper felt a twinge of loneliness though he wished his friend well.\n \n \nA few days later\u2026\n\u201cWe\u2019re in love, in love, in LOVE!\u201d expressed the orange cat as he leapt about the pink frilly store.\u00a0\u201cIt worked!\u00a0I love Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d He was acting like a kitten discovering a tiny bouncing red light flicking here and there.\nKiller stopped frolicking when he noticed the sadness in his friend.\u00a0He said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nPepper\u2019s little grey legs skittered quickly to keep up with the cat\u2019s long strides.\u00a0At the step across the street, the door opened, and Freddy came out to nuzzle Killer\u2019s face.\u00a0The dark-haired boy of about ten goggled in surprise when he saw the rat.\u00a0His freckled, dimpled face broke into an ear-to-ear grin as he dropped to his knees and bent with his hands open.\nKiller said to Pepper, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u00a0He\u2019s waited a long time for this.\u201d\nHe ran into the boy\u2019s hands and smiled at the giant face with the huge eyes. He was whirled around like a kid in a Tiltawhirl carnival ride.\u00a0The big, grown-up version of the boy came out to see what had caused all the commotion.\u00a0The boy let Pepper scamper up his arm.\u00a0He giggled as Pepper snuggled against his neck and said, \u201ccan I keep him?\u00a0Huh Dad?\u00a0Can I?\u00a0Pleeeeeeeeeeze!\u201d\nThe man studied the rat.\u00a0It was looking back at the man just as intently, as if holding its breath.\u00a0At last, the man said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s something special about him that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0Sure son.\u00a0I suppose Valentine\u2019s gifts are meant for all kinds of loved ones, eh?\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Chamomile, It Helps", "story": " \nThe soft whistling sound and the sight of steam emerging from the stainless steel tea kettle was what captured Charmaine Wilson\u2019s attention. Her barefeet softly padded against the wood floors, the legs of her plaid pajama bottoms whispered softly against the floor. She made her way to the stove and turned the silver knob, causing the small red light to disappear. Her fingers then curled around the handle of the kettle as she removed the appliance from the stove ring.\n \nShe moved quietly around the kitchen, working in the dim light provided by the small light fixture which was displayed above the sink. Her fingers curled around the porcelain \nmug as she moved the object to the marble surface of her counter. She placed a small \ntea packet into the mug before pouring the boiling hot water into the small mug. Bubbles formed, steam rushed into the air. She put the kettle down onto the counter then simply leaned against the counter as she pulled the navy blue cardigan around her tank top and pajama bottoms combo a little more.\n \nMaybe a nice hot cup of \n tea would help her sleep tonight.\n \nSometimes the cases that she and her squad worked would get to her. She loved working in law enforcement. She had no doubt that it was her calling; that she was meant to be a driving force in this male dominated industry. She and her squad had a case closure rate that surpassed any other unit within the FBI, all because of how fiercely dedicated they all were to the job of bringing home endangered individuals. Charmaine was often praised for her ability to lead her squad; the way she always stood her ground, the way she took absolutely no nonsense, the way she would work until a case was solved.\n \nBut then there were cases like their latest one: a case that ended up being a recovery rather than a rescue mission. An innocent four year old child that had been so cruelly snatched from her own front yard, only to be transported across the state line and found dead in an abandoned house, nearly a hundred miles away from her home. Charmaine struggled with cases like these where an innocent child was involved. The thought of anything happening to a child was too much to bear, but she had managed to keep a rather stoic expression throughout the recovery portion. She had learned to keep it together during these tough cases. She had learned not to fall apart when conducting notifications. She had learned to not react in anger when interrogating the sickest criminals.\n \nBut it was when she returned home to DC that she allowed herself to just feel, and to fall apart. Since returning to her DC apartment, her mind had been flooded with images of the four year old girl: the bruises, the evidence of strangulation. Filth surrounded the child, and yet, she looked as though she was sleeping. She didn\u2019t look scared. She just looked like she was sleeping.\n \nEverytime Charmaine tried to close her eyes, the image of this child flooded her mind. If she allowed her mind to wander as she lay in the silence, she swore she could hear the screams of the heartbroken mother that flooded the air when they delivered the gut-wrenching news. If she stared into the darkness for too long, she swore she could see the sinister smirk of scumbag they\u2019d arrested for this heinous crime.\n \nAnd now all of that led to this moment: her standing in the small kitchen of her apartment, leaned against the kitchen counter, making a small cup of Chamomile tea.\n \nShe glanced at the glowing green digital clock on the stove: \nFive minutes had passed; her tea was ready.\n \nShe removed the bag and tossed it into the trash, then proceeded to add a little honey and sugar to her tea. As she stirred the contents of her mug, the only sound to be heard was a soft clink sound as the silver spoon tapped the inside of the mug with each twirl. She was staring intently at the light grey marble tile of the wall, slowly losing herself in her thoughts once more until-\n \n\u201cCharm, what you doing, baby?\u201d\n \nHer thought bubble shattered as the deep voice filtered into her ears. She looked over her shoulder, only to find her boyfriend Thomas making his way towards her. Exhaustion was evident as he stepped closer, only clad in a pair of sweatpants that he often kept at her apartment. She knew he was just as tired as she was; after all, days of working a case left little room for them to sleep. However, he could sometimes handle cases better than she could. Sometimes he could push the images from his mind and just succumb to exhaustion, like he had done tonight.\n \nCharmaine offered a small smile; \u201cI\u2019m making tea.\u201d\n \n\u201cAt four in the morning?\u201d\n \n\u201cI haven\u2019t slept,\u201d Charmaine shrugged a little as she took the spoon out of her drink; \u201cSometimes when I can\u2019t sleep, I drink some tea and cry a little, and then I\u2019m good.\u201d\n \nThomas hummed in understanding while nodding his head. He figured that this had affected Charmaine on a deep level. He didn\u2019t miss the way she was so quiet on the plane, absently staring out the window with her brow furrowed. She was quiet during the ride back to her apartment, quiet as they settled in for the night.\n \nThomas stroked his fingers against her waist and pressed a tender kiss to the side of her head. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he inquired.\n \n\u201cNot right now, baby; I just want to sit down and drink my tea.\u201d\u00a0\n \nThomas nodded his head. They made their way over to the stools of the kitchen island and sat beside each other. The silence wasn\u2019t awkward but it wasn\u2019t comfortable either. Charmaine was trying to relax and Thomas didn\u2019t want to push her.\n \nThey were silent for a few moments then she spoke;\n \n\u201cI keep a box of Chamomile in the cabinet; bring it out after the bad cases, like this latest one.\u201d\n \nThomas nodded as he looked at her; \u201cDoes it help?\u201d\n \n\u201cAlways does.\u201d\n \nThey fell into silence again. Her fingers were curled around the mug as she brought it to her lips for another sip. The drink was warm as it ran down her throat. She and Thomas didn\u2019t really need to talk right now. Sometimes, they needed to just sit in silence.\n \nSo they did. They sat in silence. They silently processed how they were feeling. Thomas kept a comforting hand on her back while she sipped her tea. They both knew this case hadn\u2019t turned out the way they had hoped, but they had gotten another monster off the streets and that was a win in somebody\u2019s eyes.\n \nCharmaine finished her tea before pushing the mug aside. She turned on the stool, her knee bumping against Thomas\u2019s leg as she spoke; \u201cLet\u2019s try this sleeping thing again.\u201d\n \nThomas chuckled a little, tilting his head as he gazed at her; \u201cYou sure?\u201d\n \nCharmaine gave a soft nod of the head. \u201cChamomile; it helps.\u201d\nThomas simply smiled before standing up along with her. She put her mug in the sink and made sure all appliances and lights were switched off, then she and Thomas made their way back to her room. As he climbed into bed, she tossed her sweater aside before climbing into bed with him. His strong arms slipped around her slender frame, and she found herself resting her head on his chest.\nIt was nearly five in the morning now, and she was thankful that they had today off to rest.\n \nShe took a deep breath before closing her eyes. Maybe the chamomile tea would help. Maybe her thoughts would finally relax long enough so she could go to sleep."}
{"title": "The Sultan's Daughter", "story": "There lived long ago a sultan of a great kingdom-on-the-mountain. But it happened that the kingdom entered war with another, and the tide of the conflict threatened to take everything from the sultan. In order to survive, the sultan sought help from three powerful princes.\n \nThe sultan first sought help from the prince in the north, whose subjects called him the vain prince. The vain prince sent many beautiful cloaks, furs, and boots to warm the sultan\u2019s soldiers. In return, the sultan promised the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage.\n \nThe sultan next sought help from the prince in the east, whose subjects called him the gluttonous prince. The gluttonous prince sent many fat lambs, cows, and chickens to feed the sultan\u2019s soldiers. In return, the sultan again promised the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage.\n \nFinally, the sultan sought help from the prince in the south, whose subjects called him the greedy prince. The greedy prince sent chests of silver, copper, and jewels to pay the sultan\u2019s soldiers. In return, the sultan once more promised the hand of his eldest daughter in marriage.\n \nWith the aid of the three princes, the tide of the war slowly turned. For twelve long years the sultan fought, but finally there came a day when the fighting was finished and the war was won. The queen came to congratulate her husband and share in the joy of peace, but she was surprised to find him distraught.\n \n\"Dear husband, why are you so worried? Should we not celebrate the happy end of the long war?\" she asked.\u00a0\n \nThe sultan replied, \"Dear wife, I fear more fighting may soon begin. To keep our soldiers warm, I promised the vain prince our eldest daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. And to keep our soldiers fed, I promised the gluttonous prince our eldest daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. And to keep our soldiers paid, I promised the greedy prince our eldest daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. I fear that tomorrow, the three princes will come up the mountain to claim what they are owed!\"\n \nAnd upon hearing these words, the queen joined her husband in grief, and wept, for she knew that they had no daughter.\n \n***\n \nOn the day the suitors were due to arrive, the sultan sought help from his trusted vizier. The vizier was known for being very clever, and for solving impossible problems. The vizier quickly devised a plan, and the sultan\u2019s fears were calmed.\n \nThe vain prince arrived first. He wore a fine silk robe and his sword was polished to a mirror shine so that he could always see his reflection. The prince entered the sultan\u2019s throne room and said, \u201cI have come for your eldest daughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d\n \nThe vizier replied, \u201cThe princess is eager to meet you. But please be humble, she lost an eye and a leg during the great war, and may look frightening. We will go fetch her,\u201d and the vizier left with the sultan, but when they returned the vain prince had already fled.\n \nNext arrived the gluttonous prince. He was as wide as the chamber door, and ate from each hand two meticulously seasoned turkey legs. The prince entered the sultan\u2019s throne room and said, \u201cI have come for your eldest daughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d\n \nThe vizier replied, \u201cThe princess is eager to meet you. But please be temperate, she loves to cook and has prepared her favorite soup for you: horsehair and lime, and she prays you will enjoy it. We will go fetch her,\u201d and the vizier left with the sultan, but when they returned the gluttonous prince had already fled.\n \nFinally, the greedy prince arrived. He wore an ornate crown larger than his own head and, as he walked, servants unfurled rich velvet beneath his feet. The prince entered the sultan\u2019s throne room and said, \u201cI have come for your eldest daughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d\n \nThe vizier replied, \u201cThe princess is eager to meet you. But please be charitable, all of her dowry was spent on the long war, and now she is as poor as a beggar-maid. We will go fetch her,\u201d and the vizier left with the sultan, but when they returned the greedy prince had already fled.\n \nWith the three princes gone, the sultan was overjoyed, and planned a great feast to celebrate. But the feast would not be a happy one, for there was only one road down the great mountain, and it happened that the three princes came upon one another, and they fell into conversation.\n \n\u201cI was to be married, but I learned that the bride was terribly ugly, so I fled,\u201d said the vain prince.\n \n\u201cI was to be married, but I learned that the bride was a terrible cook, so I fled,\u201d said the gluttonous prince.\n \n\u201cI was to be married, but I learned that the bride was terribly impoverished, so I fled,\u201d said the greedy prince.\n \nBut for their faults, the three princes were not stupid, and they soon realized that they had been tricked by the same vizier. They grew angry and resolved to get answers from the sultan for his deception. So the three princes rode back up the mountain together, and they came upon the sultan enjoying a great feast with music, dancing, and wine. The musicians stopped playing at the sight of the three princes and a silence fell over the hall.\n \n\u201cWhat an ugly lie!\u201d said one prince.\n \n\u201cThat behavior was disgusting!\u201d said another.\n \n\u201cYour promises have no worth!\u201d said the third.\n \nThe three princes continued to express their anger while the sultan solemnly listened. Finally, they demanded that the sultan fetch his eldest daughter without delay, or they would bring war to the kingdom-on-the-mountain.\n \nThe sultan, finally breaking his silence, realized that he could do nothing but be honest. He turned to the princes and spoke these words:\n "}

I. Wrecked. The. Car.\u201d She caterwauls, falling into my arms. She smells of alcohol, tobacco, and my perfume, which disappeared from my vanity last month. \n\u201cSlow down. Tell me what happened.\u201d\nI hand her a box of tissues and she blows her nose.\u00a0\nI wait, wrapping a thick fleece blanket around myself.

Any flavor. Doesn't matter.\u00a0\n\u201cTell me exactly what happened,\u201d I pull back, looking into her tragic, raccoon eyes. I note she has a new facial piercing. I ignore it (for now) and affix a look of genuine concern.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, Mom,\u201d she sniffs dramatically. \u201cSo I backed into a car at Taco Bell. And then the driver was really mean to me\u2014he yelled! So I left, but I ran over his foot.\u201d\nI raise my eyebrows and start counting the felonies.\u00a0\n\u201cOn the way home, a cop followed me. He pulled me over. I waited until he was out of his car\u2014then I took off!\u201d\n\u201cYou. took. off.\u201d\n\u201cI was scared because I had been drinking\u2014\u201d her lower lip trembles. \u201cAnd then I hit the sign.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sign?\u201d\n\u201cThe sign outside our subdivision. The Walnut Grove sign.\u201d\n\u201c\n. You ran the car into a brick wall?\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she cries. She buries her face into my chest, wiping her nose on my nightgown like a five year old. The thought of strangling her seems very appealing.\n\u201cDarling, I\u2019m going to need you to take a shower and go to bed. When dad gets home, I\u2019ll talk to him. We\u2019ll sort it out. Just go to bed now, all right?\u201d\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she blubbers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mom,\u201d she apologizes, but the apology is insincere. She is sorry she got caught.\u00a0\nWhen she leaves, I lay down on the bedroom floor instead of making up the bed. I gather most of the pillows in a heap and briefly consider making a pillow fort. How nice it would be to have someone else to deal with aging parents and adult children.\u00a0\nI sulk, staring at the ceiling.\u00a0\n, my mother complained one afternoon when I came home from school. I didn\u2019t know what she meant and asked her to make me a ham and swiss. I had wondered why she burst into both tears and laughter at my request.\nNow I know. I am in between two generations whose incessant needs make me wonder who I am.\n\u201cEvery woman in her fifties wants to run away,\u201d my mother told me before she died. \u201cAnd the ones who don\u2019t are few and far between.\u201d\n\u201cI think I hate everyone,\u201d I confessed to her. \u201cEspecially men.\u201d\n\u201c\nstruation. \nopause. \ntal breakdown.

{"title": "As Children Do", "story": "\u201cNinety-Seven, Ninety-Eight, Ninety-Nine, ONE HUNDRED. Ready or not! HERE I COME!\u201d I spun out of the corner I had smushed my face into. The herringbone parquet flooring glows golden, reflecting the light from the hallway lamps. My Mary-Janes slap against it as I run towards the giant mahogany staircase. I reach the carpet covered stairway and start thundering up them with the abandon of youth and enthusiasm. As I run, the crystal tear drops of the chandelier tinkle as they vibrate and shake from the force of my passage. Mrs McIntosh, the housekeeper always says that me running up the stairs reminds her of how the earth shook under the floor of her first flat every time a train passed. I find that quite odd.\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0only six. I\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0make as much noise as a train. Can I? I slow, dragging my hand, as children do, along the baluster\u2019s, revelling in the slap, slap sound as my fingers\u00a0bounce\u00a0from post to carved post.\nI reach the top of the stairs, pausing. Which way? I wonder as I try and catch my breath. \u201cJack!\u201d I call softly, \u201cJack, I\u2019m not playing anymore\u201d I cry, hoping to trick him. I wait, ears straining. I look at the three hallways branching off the landing. Which way? I tap a finger to my lip like Mum does when she is thinking. The first hallway is in darkness and leads towards Poppa\u2019s room. He would not be there, not after the last time we were caught there. I\u00a0can't\u00a0decide between the hallway leading to the servant stairs or the one leading to the back of the house.\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0spin, I decide. I step towards the middle of the landing, close my eyes and spin around and around until I completely lose my balance, as children do. I fall in a heap, giggling to myself. I lay, arms and legs wide, staring up at the ceiling until the giant ceiling rose stops moving.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I am steady, I push myself up to my elbows, shake my hair out of my eyes, as children do. And look down to see that my Mary -Janes are now pointing me towards the back of the house. I scramble up quickly, decision made. I walk forward, my eyes landing on the pale green wallpaper covered in beautiful emerald peacocks, their trains standing up behind them, Poppa says they can have up to 175 feathers in their\u00a0trains, I\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0count that high yet, but I think\u00a0it's\u00a0a lot more than 20. In-between them, are the indigo butterflies, Poppa says, the blue colour comes from peas, but he must be wrong because peas are green. And in amongst the peacocks and butterflies are the golden hummingbirds, Poppa says that they are the only birds that can fly backwards, why would they do that though? The green colour is\u00a0sage,\u00a0and Poppa says its special Chinese silk that he found in the orient when he was there for the war. I\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0know where the orient is but Mum says people do not call it that anymore and I\u00a0shouldn\u2019t\u00a0either.\nI continue\u00a0down the hallway, dragging my fingers along the wallpaper, as children do, loving the tingly feel in my fingertips. I lift my hand from the wall as I reach the large window, I want to climb onto the sill and push my\u00a0face to the glass, but Mrs Mac made me clean 3 whole windows the last time I did that. I stand and carefully put my hands behind my back. As I look out across the normally green lawn and towards the oak and birch trees, the wind gusts and rain hit\u2019s the window like water thrown from a bucket. I jump back,\u00a0alarmed,\u00a0and give a little shiver, glad to be warm inside Poppa\u2019s house on such a miserable day. I turn from the window and start moving forward again, trying to count the butterflies on the wall.\u00a0\nLost in my thoughts, I almost forget why I am here and then, my ears prick a little, was that a creak? I know what makes that creak, \u201cI\u2019m coming Jack! I found you!\u201d I yell as down the hallway towards the single flight of wibbly wobbly stairs I go. Of course, Jack ends up where he is not supposed to be, now we will both be in trouble. I mount the stairs and notice the big blue door is\u00a0not quite closed. I hesitate for a moment, Mrs Mac told us to stay out of this room today. I bite my lip, what if Jack is in there by himself? What if he breaks something? My heart pounds at the thought, remembering the blown glass horse figurines on the desk and the blue vase as tall as I am, oh no, what if he knocks it over? Fearing the worst, I push the door open quietly, holding my breath and tip toe into the room as children do. The attic is huge, as large as the whole house. One wall is all windows with a lovely wide window seat, perfect for curling up with a good adventure story, which you could easily find on one of the other three walls which are floor to ceiling shelves overflowing with books of every kind.\u00a0\u00a0\nI sneak forward slowly. \u201cJack?\u201d I whisper. \u201cHello poppet\u201d says a voice that is gravelly and smooth all at the same time.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0coming from the big red armchair in front of the roaring fireplace. There is a precarious pile of books on one side and a table with two mugs and a plate of biscuits on the other. \u201cHello Poppa,\u201d I say. I walk towards the chair. \u201cJack! You traitor!\u201d I exclaim as I see that Jack, my faithful hound, my\u00a0supposed hide\u00a0and seek playmate is curled up on Poppa\u2019s lap enjoying the warmth of the fire. Not hiding at all. Poppa chuckles, \u201cCome sit down and tell me about your day, Mrs Mac brought you up a hot chocolate.\u201d I flop down on the rug and sigh as children do, wondering how she knew I would end up here? I shrug and reach for a biscuit.\u00a0\u00a0"}

Until we reach our favorite camp spot, passing through the local forest to get there.\nIt\u2019s about a 5 mile walk from our small town here\n\u00a0In Sweden, which most of us grew up in. Our families migrated from England, during the logging boom, here in the early eighties, let\u2019s just say they needed the money!\nIt\u2019s around this part of the trip, especially now that we are much older, that the first sip of our good friend ...whisky, usually comes out.\n\u201cHey Jennifer, remember that old swing we built, when we were around 7? The rope is still hanging over there, we have to rebuild it one day!\u201d Thomas comments, pointing to our left, near an old branch covered in snow.\n\u201cOf course, I remember! You say this every year and every year I agree, but tell me what happens Tom ....?\u201c\n\u00a0We both look at each other with a smirk.\n\u201cYeh alright Jen, now shut up and take a drink, your dry mouth sod.\u201d The group starts laughing, as he passes me the flask.\nSophie quickly turns to the group, \u201cguys be quiet! Can you here that??\nI think we have company tonight,\u201d and with a evil smile, she turns around and marches ahead.\n\u201cYou mean the wolves? Good, I\u2019m glad!\nMaybe they like whiskey and s\u2019mores and perhaps we can ride them home tomorrow, when we all hungover, on deaths door. Save the walk?\u201d I add.\n\u201cNow you\u2019re talking Jen,\nBut I think I\u2019d rather to ride a bear, i prefer comfort over speed,\u201d Corey adds.\n\u201cStill doesn\u2019t explain your right awful haircut, though does it Corey? Did your mum want you to look like a twat, or was that specifically what you were going for??\nYou look like Fredrick who owns the rug shop intown and we all know, a man with that many rugs... is hiding something! \u201d Thomas replies.\n\u201cOkay, okay, I get it guys, just leave poor Frederick out of it. You know he hasn\u2019t been the same since his wife left!\u201d Corey replies.\n\u00a0\u201cDid she leave or disappear?\u201d Thomas questions\n\u201cYeh someone better check under those rugs!\u201d Sophie remarks\n\u201cHaha ok enough with the conspiracies, anyway I think my mother did a cracking job, with my hair. At least she didn\u2019t cut my ears off, besides It\u2019s lockdown guys, who have I got to impress?. I\u2019ve got more chance with a muskrat, then any girls in this bloody town!\u201d. Corey adds\u2026 and he was right. He hadn\u2019t had much luck with the women for a while and it was mating season for the muskrat.\n\u00a0Finally, we arrive at the clearing of our campsite.\n\u201cThank god!\u201d I thankfully drop all my heavy gear onto the ground and stretch my arms.\n\u201cI swear Jen, like mother like daughter, every time I see your mum in town, she\u2019s carrying around 10 bags on each arm, like she\u2019s marry bloody Poppins and your worse!\u201d\n\u201cThanks Sophie, what can I say my families been carrying this town for generations! Now let\u2019s grab some wood for the fire, before you complain about the cold again.\u201d\n\u00a0We both race off, to find something we can burn, in between the distant howls and echoes of the wind that chase through trees.\nAs we sit around the newly built fire, we start to sing a few drunken tunes, from our childhood. Cleary part of our ridiculously ongoing tradition!\n\u201cThree cheers to winter,\nWhat feels like a splinter,\nLord knows it might kill ya,\nSo pour me a drink!\nAnd if i die hastily,\nFrom pork rum and pastry,\nThe heavens shall chase me,\nSo pour meeeee\nA\nDrinkkkkk!!!!\u201d\nWe all shout.\nAlmost falling into the fire as will spill our baileys and whiskey with laughter.\n\u201cSophie, Sophie please tell me you brought your camera!?

a splash of blue feathers drifted in its wake.\u00a0Before hitting the ground, a tiny figure leapt from the bird\u2019s back.\n\t\tThe wee elf tucked into a ball and rolled somersaults atop the snowy ground.\u00a0It came to a stop in front of Jaxon\u2019s nose, spraying the goat\u2019s astonished face with fine, icy flakes.\u00a0The enchanting elf bounced to her feet and looked around for her bird.\u00a0In forest green tights and pointy brown booties, she was a blur of green as she raced to her feathered companion, she skidded to a halt at its chest.\u00a0Her pretty, pale face all but disappeared in soft blue feathers as she listened for a heartbeat.\n\t\tJaxon said quietly, \u201cis he dead?\u201d\n\t\tThe wee she elf spun towards the voice as if she\u2019d forgotten he was there.\u00a0He was used to that.\n\t\tShe said, \u201cNo, \n heart beats.\u201d\n\t\tThe goat and elf looked up into the treetops.\u00a0The evil black duo was gone.\n\t\tJaxon fired off questions, \u201cwhat was that?\u00a0You\u2019re an elf, aren\u2019t you?\u00a0Where are we?\u201d\n\t\tThe pretty little elf put her mittened hands on her hips.\u00a0She wore a silky, long-sleeved tunic, emerald-green, with bronze colored embroidery, a yellow scarf and belt.\u00a0Ash blond hair spiked out from her acorn helmet.\u00a0She \u2018\n\u2019 and removed the nutshell from her head, her hair spilled in messy cornsilk waves down her back to her knees.\u00a0As she neared the young goat, he saw that her enormous eyes were chocolate brown with gold and amber flecks.\u00a0She looked like one of those old 1970s paintings of waifs with ginormous eyes.\u00a0\n\t\tShe said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m an elf\u2026duh.\u00a0That was a Nordicbalphi, a Nordif for short.\u201d\u00a0She added cryptically, \u201cWe are not far from my home, though I fear I have no way to get there.\u00a0I won\u2019t leave Blue-Berry Twinkle-Toes.\u201d She looked sadly at the jay, tears magnified her mysterious dark eyes.\u00a0One escaped, it slid down her rosy cheeks, and dropped from her pointy chin.\u00a0When it hit the snow, a tiny spray of golden glitter \n.\n\t\tA flurry of fluttering wingbeats filled the clearing, a flurry of snowflakes drifted to the ground.\n\t\tCardinals, goldfinches, chickadees, robins, and more alit on low lying branches, each carrying a wee elf dressed in similar outfits- tunics and tights, scarves and mittens- in a plethora of mainly green shades.\n\t\tThe elf next to Jaxon said, \u201cThis is my family.\u00a0I\u2019m Astra-Senika by the way\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\u201cI\u2019m Jaxon.\u00a0I can help you get home\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\u201cIt\u2019ll be dangerous.\u00a0The Nordif are out in full force.\u00a0We are losing the battle against them.\u00a0I fear we may lose not only our home, but our entire race.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cI have no family.\u00a0I have nothing to lose.\u00a0Let me help you.\u201d\n\t\tAstra looked into Jaxon\u2019s sad, nearly black eyes for a few seconds then nodded.\u00a0\u201cWhat a shame.\u00a0You have such a good heart, young goat.\u201d\n\t\tShe called to her clan who waited silently in the trees.\u00a0\u201cThis is Jaxon Jesse Simpson\u2026\u201d\n\t\tJaxon goggled at her. \n\t\tShe continued, \u201c\u2026he is going to help me home.\u201d\n\t\tThe elves in the trees, mounted on songbirds, chattered amongst themselves.\u00a0At last, the oldest, with snow white hair and a knee length, double-braided beard, called down, \u201cvery well, daughter.\u00a0We will escort you from above, lest the demon Nordifs return.\u201d\n\t\tOne by one, each bird-mounted elf dropped long, colorful filaments to the ground.\u00a0Orange, yellow, red and purple silk-like threads floated down gracefully.\u00a0Astra gathered them up quickly and tied them all together in one, ten-foot-long cord.\n\t\t\n\t\tShe whispered into Berry\u2019s ear.\u00a0The bird\u2019s head lifted wearily.\u00a0She rose shakily to her feet and cried out as her broken wing dropped to the ground.\u00a0\n\t\tOne of the goldfinches came down and silently landed by the jay like a fluffy, lemony yellow pompom with legs and small, pointy beak.\u00a0A thin elf with honey colored hair, wearing moss green tunic and tights, leapt like a ballet dancer, from the pretty bird\u2019s back.\u00a0Astra and the male elf, Branon, secured the poor blue jay\u2019s wing to her side.\u00a0Then, with Astra on one side of Jaxon, and Branon, on the other, they lifted the blue jay onto Jaxon\u2019s shoulders and secured the bird with the remainder of the silken cord.\n\t\tBrannon gave a little salute to the loaded-up goat and leapt upon his finch\u2019s back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\tFour miles into the woods, the sky grew dark. \n\t\tAstra lifted her tiny mittened hands to the sky.\u00a0The clouds parted, revealing the brilliant white orb of a moon.\u00a0Astra\u2019s hands filled with moonlight. The magical lantern was small but bright.\u00a0High above them, two dozen more tiny lanterns glowed, and the sky was filled with flying stars.\n\t\tThe trees were getting sparser, and the icy, frozen ground inclined upwards at sharper and sharper an angle. Astra told the sure-footed goat stories of their enemy, the Nordif, as they ascended the mountain.\u00a0They were an ancient race of elves from the deepest bowels of Norway hills, displaced by ore mining humans.\u00a0They sought to take over Astra\u2019s race of Kindweenots. Their leader, Drookin, sought ultimate power through the death of Astra, the most powerful, magic elf their world had ever seen.\u00a0He intended to enslave them and use their magic for his own elevation to a God-like status.\u00a0He would drain them of their powers- their life-force- then toss the husks away like garbage.\u00a0And he dreamed of taking revenge up the human race.\n\t\t\u201cWe live at the top of this mountain, inside it.\u00a0When the Nordifs discover this, we will be doomed\u2026\u201d \n\t\tJust then, the entire mountain quaked.\u00a0The earth under Jaxon\u2019s small hooves reverberated with thunder, his feet did a scary little skittering dance, his back legs slipped over the steep edge\u2026but only for a few seconds.\u00a0After the shock wore off, he found his feet and continued up the steep slope with fierce determination.\n\t\tThe elves in the air chattered excitedly, in alarm.\n\t\t\n\t\tSuddenly, the air around Jaxon and Astra was filled with huge, flapping black flags!\u00a0\n\t\tThe ravens swooped and swirled, cutting Astra and Jaxon off from the rest of their clan.\u00a0Over Jaxon\u2019s head, Astra fired a white-hot fireball from her palms.\u00a0She nailed a raven\u2019s wing and it screamed in fury as it fell\u2026a thousand feet below.\u00a0Two more ravens fell past them, haven taken shots from overhead.\u00a0Then a soft, greyish-brown wren fell past, fluttering a single wing uselessly.\u00a0Astra pulled the bird and rider in on a strand of silken rope like a fisherman reeling in a trout.\u00a0They clung to the cords around Jaxon\u2019s shoulders.\n\t\tA raven, the largest by nearly twice the size of the others, circled Jaxon\u2019s group. \t\t\t\t\n\t\tAstra yelled, \u201cDrookin! Faster! Faster Jaxon!\u201d\n\t\tDrookin sent a whitish blue bolt of lightning at a cardinal that swooped down close.\u00a0She yelled, \u201cNo!\u201d And shot a yellow-tailed bolt that intercepted the blue one.\u00a0They burst together in a retina-scorching display of fireworks.\u00a0As soon as Astra had let go of the last bolt, Drookin had one aimed at her.\u00a0She was too late to deflect it.\u00a0It knocked her flat against Jaxon\u2019s neck. \n\t\tHe felt hot, burning, embers and smelled singed fur.\u00a0He called out, \u201cAstra!\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\tHe got no answer from her.\u00a0The elf they had rescued sobbed and said into Jaxon\u2019s left ear, \u201cShe\u2019s dead!\u201d \n\t\t\n\t\tA flurry of fire balls erupted angrily over their heads and three more ravens fell head over heels past them, black feathers swirled in the gale winds. \u00a0Their strapped-on stick-figure demon riders, either flopped limply, like knobby bags of bones\u2026\u00a0or they flayed futilely to get free.\n\u00a0\n\t\tThe elves disappeared over the tip top of the mountain.\u00a0Jaxon struggled to follow them to their world.\u00a0The snow was a storm at the apex, it all but blinded the relentless goat \n\t\t\u201cThere!\u201d cried the elf on his back. Jaxon forced himself still.\u00a0His legs trembled with the urgency to keep going, down the other side.\u00a0\n\t\tHe strained to see what the elf was pointing to.\u00a0\n\u00a0Jaxon wondered if he\u2019d fit.\u00a0\n\t\tAs if reading his mind, the elf yelled over the shrieking wind, \u201cIt\u2019s wider than it looks!\u00a0The entire length is covered by ice and snow!\u201d\n\t\tJaxon nodded, and with renewed strength made his way quickly down the steep slope, sliding and scrabbling for footholds the whole way.\n\t\tThe giant raven screeched in his right ear!\u00a0He jumped, losing his footing for a few seconds.\u00a0\u201cHold on hold on!\u201d Screamed the elf from his neck, \u201calmost there!\u201d\n\t\tJaxon was close enough to see half a dozen tiny green clad arms waving them on like grass stalks bristling in the wind.\n\t\tThe raven swooped and hovered directly in front of Jaxon\u2019s face, blocking his advance.\u00a0\n\t\tThen \u2018\n\u2019 A bluey-white fireball, sizzling with electricity, came straight at him!\u00a0It flashed between his eyes and hurt like nothing he\u2019d felt before.\u00a0He was blind!\u00a0He made his feet move, but they galloped in nothing but thin air!\u00a0\n\t\tThe raven screeched in pain and anger, its harsh voice disappeared downwards\u2026\u00a0he heard the feathers rustling, heading down.\n\u00a0\t\tThe elf on his back said, \u201cAstra\u2019s spelled you.\u00a0After you were hit, the fireball rebounded at the bird!\u00a0Double strength!\u00a0Whoo-hoo!\u201d\n\t\t\n\t\tHe slammed into a snowy ledge and tried scabbling onto it.\u00a0He managed to stand into a crouch but, still being blind and discombobulated, took a step in the wrong direction. He felt himself tumbling down into blood-freezing, empty space. The wee being screamed so high-pitchedly in his ear, it was nearly soundless, like a dog whistle.\n\t\tIn silent blackness his consciousness left him.\n\t\tGradually, the edges of his vision brightened to grey\u2026then came on full force.\u00a0He looked down and saw white and green and patches of brown streaking past, far below!\u00a0His small, shiny black hooves were galloping\u2026in thin air! \u00a0The ground at least twelve hundred feet below! \n\u2019 He thought, \u2018\n\t\tHe looked up and screamed! He\u2019d nearly flown right into the mountain that he recognized as the home of the elves.\u00a0The elf on his back joined his scream and pulled up on the cords as if they were reigns.\u00a0The jay cawed and the wren squeaked a cry.\u00a0Jaxon flew vertically up another four hundred feet to the mountain top, as if pulled up like a kite on the wind.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe sky was clearing, the top was level with the few remaining wispy clouds.\u00a0They breezed away into the starry, black night.\u00a0The crevasse was easy to spot.\u00a0A lantern was burning warm, welcoming sunny light.\u00a0As Jaxon and his riders approached the entrance, two elf sentries in green and gold waved frantically and laughed and cheered.\n\t\tAs Jaxon landed at the cavern mouth, two dozen more elves had appeared.\u00a0They quickly untied the birds and Astra\u2019s lifeless body and whisked them away inside.\u00a0Jaxon squeezed through the narrow opening and followed the elves down deep into the bowels of the mountain. \u00a0It was warm and cozy, with high, vaulted ceilings of natural granite.\u00a0Hundreds of tiny moonlight lanterns lit up the vast space.\u00a0The walls and ceiling sparkled magically with mica that caught the lantern light. \n\t\tAn old elf woman, the elder\u2019s wife, brought the worn-out goat a warm drink of herbs and cinnamon.\u00a0In minutes he was asleep.\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, he awoke in a large, toasty-warm room with rows of beds like a hospital.\u00a0He was amused to see the elves had put four of their largest beds together for him, yet his hooves still hung over the end.\n\t\tNext to him was the jay bird, her wing bandaged against her body.\u00a0He turned over and saw Astra, fast asleep in the next bed.\u00a0She was breathing and alive, though bandages covered her arms, and her face was reddened as if sunburnt. \u00a0Branon sat at her side and held her hand.\u00a0He turned around to Jaxon and said, \u201cshe\u2019ll be fine in a week or so\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\u201cThank goodness!\u00a0So, it wasn\u2019t a dream then?\u00a0I really flew?\u201d\n\t\t\u201cMy heaven\u2019s yes!\u00a0No!\u00a0I mean yes, you can fly!\u00a0And no, you weren\u2019t dreaming!\u201d He laughed in delight at the goat\u2019s wondering, elated expression.\u00a0He said, \u201cAstra spelled you so you could save us all!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cBut I fell\u2026I nearly killed us all\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\u201cWithout you, Astra would be no longer and the Nordifs would either enslave us or slaughter us.\u00a0She is still only a child- our savior- her powers will grow as she matures.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cLike the baby Jesus\u2026\u201d\u00a0Jaxon said under his breath.\u00a0Louder, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go!\u00a0I\u2019m needed at home!\u201d\n\t\tThe elder elves and a few of the others had joined Branon.\u00a0The eldest with the long white beard said, \u201cYes, you must go now.\u00a0The flying spell won\u2019t last much longer, though long enough to see you home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n***\n\u00a0\nOn the stage of the school auditorium, Jaxon Jesse Simpson looked out at the audience.\u00a0Every seat was filled, and every face glowed with Christmas cheer.\u00a0\n\t\tHe proudly stood in the back row of animals, in between a white pygmy goat smaller than he, and a pretty little chestnut filly, excitedly hopping from hoof to hoof.\u00a0He looked at the three wise men, the opossum in the center looked up and winked at him, smiling.\n\t\tAs the entire cast sang Silent Night together, Jaxon\u2019s voice joined in. He felt in perfect harmony for the first time ever.\u00a0He saw at the very back of the theatre, in the ebony darkness, two hundred tiny yellowy white sparks, wavering to and fro along with the song that filled the air.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"}
{"title": "The Christmas Hat", "story": "Miss Smithereen, as excited as her class, stood in front of the chalkboard. The short, spiney quills down her back poked through the soft red wool of her most Christmassy dress.\u00a0She stamped her tiny hedgehog feet, shod in sensible black penny loafers, and clapped her tiny hedgehog paws together for attention.\nShe pushed her eyeglasses up her pointy black nose and said, \u201cNow class, we still have an hour before the bell\u2026\u201d\nThe class of woodland animals groaned in unison.\u00a0Eddie, an outspoken raccoon child, looked around at his classmates. Every whisker quivered, the room was infused with the elated electricity that only Christmas brings.\u00a0He looked back at Miss Smithereen and noted the mischievous smile on her frosty, furry face.\u00a0It was her tradition to let the class out early on the last day before Christmas vacation. \n He wondered.\nThe old hedgehog slowly walked to the door.\u00a0She opened it and stepped aside, announcing, \u201cOff you go!\u00a0Merry Christmas!\u201d\nTwenty-two, high pitched voices nearly brought down the roof with their cheers.\u00a0The windows rattled in their panes like applause.\u00a0As the class ran out the door, Miss Smithereen called out, \u201cSee you all in a week!\u201d\nEddie shrugged into the warm winter sweater his gramma had made the year before.

He opened the flaps.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWoah.\u201d He said and looked at both his parents.\u00a0They were frowning and smiling uncertainly, like at any second it might start raining turnip pies.\u00a0The note atop a pile of snow-white tissue paper read, \u201cMade especially for you at Christmas.\u201d\nHe pulled the thin paper aside\u2026then frowned.\u00a0\u201cWhaaa---?\u201d\nGingerly he poked the thing in the box.\u00a0Then he screamed and backed away so quickly that he tripped over his tail, fell on his butt, and scrabbled like a crab across the room.\u00a0His ear-blasting scream frightened his parents, both their fur stood on end, so bloodcurdling was the sound.\nHis mother, Alice, dashed forward and looked in the box.\u00a0Her eyes turned to huge round planets as Will bent over the box.\u00a0He reached into it and pulled out\u2026a dead body?\u00a0\nIt was a hat.\u00a0A raccoon skin hat to be exact.\u00a0As the tail flopped out like a thick, striped bristle brush, all three raccoons screamed.\nWill dropped it back into the box and kicked it across the wood floor.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it mean Pop?\u00a0Is it really\u2026really\u2026\u201d the rest came out in a whisper, \u201ca dead body?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Will, \u201cit\u2019s actually just the skin and pelt\u2026and tail of a raccoon.\u201d\n\u201cOh my.\u201d Said Alice.\u00a0\u201c\n do you think it is?\u00a0Who would \n this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize him.\u00a0And with no return address, it could be from anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cIt had my name and our address on it.\u00a0It\u2019s from a serial killer.\u201d\u00a0Said Eddie with certainty.\nWill and Alice looked at their son.\u00a0Neither said anything.\u00a0Perhaps it was a serial killer playing with them.\u00a0The thing in the box was utterly ghastly.\u00a0What else could it be?\nWill locked the front door, then the back door in the kitchen too.\u00a0He shuttered the windows and latched them tight.\u00a0Alice silently washed the after-breakfast dishes while Will paced the living room floor while waiting for the police.\nWithin ten minutes, sirens wailed, and red flashing lights reflected off the snowy hillocks and tree trunks and branches, doubling their intensity into a discotheque type scene.\u00a0In front of the burrow, the forest green sheriff\u2019s car slid to a stop.\u00a0The Sheriff, a silvery grey fox, and a Deputy skunk came to the door.\nAfter taking the body away and interviewing the shaken-up family, they left.\nEddie said, \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll catch the killer?\u201d\nAlice said, \u201cThey have little to go on.\u00a0They can\u2019t autopsy on a skin.\u201d\nWill added, \u201cAnd death is an everyday occurrence in our animal world.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is torture!\u00a0It\u2019s a cruel taunt that screams, \u2018\n\u2019\u201d\u00a0Eddie wailed.\u00a0\u201cAnimals kill for food, they don\u2019t \n with their food.\u201d\n\u201cWell, there was that cousin of yours\u2026the cross-eyed one from your dad\u2019s side---\u201d\n\u201cMom!\u00a0Seriously? He played tiddlywinks with his crawdads.\u00a0This is different.\u201d\nShe sighed and wrung her stubby little fingers together.\nEddie picked up the phone and called Julian\u2019s number.\u00a0He talked for only a minute, then put down the receiver.\u00a0With a long face he said, \u201cJulian\u2019s parents won\u2019t let him come over\u2026\u201d\nWill said, \u201cYou can\u2019t really blame them.\u00a0You can go over there if you like.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie said softly, \u201cHe\u2019s not allowed to hang out with me at all.\u201d\n\u201cOh Honey,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nEddie tried Harley\u2019s number next.\u00a0And got the same result.\u00a0Harley\u2019s father had practically hung up on him.\nEddie said with a small, wavering voice, \u201cThis is the worst Christmas ever.\u201d\u00a0He seemed so small right then, not eleven, but merely three years old.\n\u201cChristmas isn\u2019t until tomorrow.\u00a0We have a feast to prepare, presents to open, songs to sing, and plenty of football on tv.\u201d\u00a0His dad said, trying to sound upbeat.\nEddie nodded gloomily and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in my room.\u00a0I don\u2019t feel so well.\u201d\n***\nAn hour later, Alice went to her son\u2019s room, a steaming mug of hot cocoa in hand, a pile of marshmallows melting into a merry, goopy treat.\u00a0She knocked softly on the door and said, \u201cEddie honey, I\u2019ve made you some cocoa, just the way you like it\u2026\u201d\nWhen she got no answer, she opened the door.\u00a0The room was empty.\n***\nEddie ran down the path through the woods.\u00a0It was growing dark, the snowy landscape bluely glowed, and black shadows grew larger and taller.\u00a0He stopped often and looked around in every direction.\u00a0He felt eyes on him.\u00a0Malicious ones, hidden in shadows.\u00a0Sticking out his red wool cap, his ears perked up like radar dishes, revolving this way and that, alert for the minutest of sounds.\nA branch snapped to his left, but he saw nothing there.\u00a0\nHe turned back to the path and\u2026\u201dAAAAAAaaaaa!!!\u201d Right in front of him!\nIt was Harley, bundled in a black muffler and matching toque.\u00a0\u201cHi Eddie!\u201d\n\u201cYou scared the snot outta me!\u00a0What\u2019re you doing out here?\u201d\n\u201cComing to help you, bro.\u00a0I snuck out.\u00a0Julian wanted to come but his dad put locks on all their windows.\u201d\n\u201cThis could be dangerous.\u00a0I think I\u2019m being followed.\u201d\nHarley looked around.\u00a0Only his beady little onyx eyes peered from his warm winter get-up.\n\u201cYour ma made you another set, eh?\u201d\nHarley nodded, \u201cShe always makes the scarf too long, she thinks it makes me look bigger.\u201d\n\u201cIt does. Fatter.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u2018\nHarley whispered harshly, panicky, \u201cDid you hear---\u201d\n\u201cShhhh!\u00a0I told you!\u201d Eddie hissed, then he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve got to find that old mail-badger and find out where the box came from.\u201d\n\u201cThe mail wagon\u2019s on the other side of these woods.\u201d Harley said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Said Eddie.\u00a0He started running.\u00a0Harley started running\u2026and tripped over the long scarf.\u00a0He wrapped up the loose end and tied it tight.\u00a0He ran after Eddie and caught up quickly- chipmunks are lightning fast\u2026raccoons, not so much.\nThe black velvet curtain of sky fell and lights from the town blinked to life.\u00a0There were just a few stars and a bright bold moon peeking out from between the low-lying charcoal clouds As they neared the edge of the forest, an enormous black shadow undulated over the sparkling, luminescent snow in front of them.\u00a0They stumble-skidded to a stop.\u00a0Eddie dove under a snowbank, pulling the chipmunk with him.\u00a0They held their breath as the colossal shadow passed by them.\u00a0It was as big as a Transformer Robot!\nAfter ten minutes, Harley peaked out from the snow.\u00a0\u201cLook.\u201d He whispered and pointed to a boxy white truck with a red and blue eagle logo on the side.\u00a0The engine was idling, plumes of silvery exhaust wafted over them.\u00a0Eddie said, \u201cThat\u2019s why the killer didn\u2019t smell us, we\u2019re downwind.\u201d They got out of the freezing snow and shook it off.\nMr.Poppinstuff emerged from the truck, he clomped onto the snow covered road.\u00a0His foot slipped and he caught the doorframe to catch his balance.\u00a0He cursed under his breath.\u00a0\n\u201cSounds like my dad,\u201d said Harley.\nAs they watched, the stooped, old grey badger in the blue uniform rolled the back gate up a third, reached inside, and wrangled a heavy looking package out.\u00a0It slipped through his mittened hands and dropped to the ground.\u00a0Mr.Poppinstuff hopped on one foot a few times, cursing fresh utterances.\u00a0He bent and retrieved the misbehaving package, then walked to the door of the last home at the edge of the woods.\n\u00a0Hot, meaty breath bellowed across their backs!\u00a0Without turning, they ran for mail truck.\u00a0Footsteps pounded behind them!\u00a0A paw half the size of Eddie\u2019s whole body swiped at his sweater, shredding the soft, thick wool.\n\u201cYikes!\u201d He squealed.\nHarley made it to the truck.\u00a0He heard the cry and raced back to his friend.\u00a0He unwound the long scarf and with it, ran circles in a Flash Gordon blur around the legs of the cougar.\u00a0The cougar roared furiously, tottered on its tied together tip toes, and fell forward like fresh hewn timber. \u2018\nEddie and Harley ran to the mail truck and dove through the narrow opening.\nThe cougar\u2019s paws whirred in a Tasmanian devil frenzy, the scarf was shredded in seconds.\u00a0It bounded after its prey.\u00a0At the mail truck, it swiped its monstrous paw through the opening.\u00a0Eddie and Harley screamed.\u00a0In the empty, boxy truck, the caterwauling vibrated the metal walls, and reverberated around them as if the little white truck had swallowed them alive.\nThe huge paw receded out the rolldown door like a snake whipping back after a strike.\u00a0The boys looked at each other, shaking, eyes wide, the echoes of their screams faded, and silence ensued.\nWait! Not quite silent\u2026A low, deep rumbling sound came to their ears.\nCurious, the raccoon and wee chipmunk dared to peek out the mail-truck door.\nThe killer cougar had backed up twenty feet.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t looking at the boys\u2019 hidey hole, it was looking at\u2026Mr.Poppinstuff!\nOnly it wasn\u2019t Mr.Poppinstuff any longer.\nThe old mail-badger had transformed into a super-hero!\u00a0He stood up straight on his hind legs and was nearly as tall as the confused cat.\u00a0The badger hissed like a demon from hell and both boys would swear his eyes glowed crimson red like ominous, firey embers.\nThe cougar took a swipe at the demon badger.\u00a0The boys heard the swish and gasped.\nThe badger screeched liked a banshee as he dodged the blow like a prize fighter.\u00a0A champion one.\u00a0The badger demon\u2019s front paws whirred in the space between the two battlers and threatened to buzz the cat\u2019s nose off like a chainsaw.\nThe cat backed up, roared, and swiped an enormous paw low.\nHe sent the badger tumbling backwards. And immediately pounced at the advantage.\u00a0It pinned the badger down and would soon tear out his throat.\nEddie leapt from the mail truck and onto the huge cat\u2019s head.\u00a0As he futilely punched the head, he screamed at the cat, \u201cYOU sent me that package! I know it!\u00a0You\u2019re a killer with a demented mind!\u00a0You\u2019ve been stalking me ever since! What is \n with you?!\u201d\nThe cat covered its vulnerable eyes with its paws and said, \u201cWhat are you \n about?!\u201d\nEddie screamed, \u201cThe body!\u00a0The hat!\u00a0The skin of one of my kin!\u201d\nThe badger was standing again, red sparks flew from its eyes, its spittle flew like acid rain, it raised its arms with shiny, sharp black claws curled.\u00a0As it lunged, the cat threw the raccoon off as if it were a rag doll.\u00a0It shouted, \u201cYou all cray-cray!\u201d And disappeared into the woods.\nMr.Poppinstuff was back in uniform, hat, and mittens.\u00a0The boys, however, would never be able to see him as anything but a superhero.\u00a0He said to Eddie, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about a serial killer?\u201d\nEddie explained his terrifying morning.\nThe mail-badger nodded with a finger aside his nose\u2026thinking.\u00a0At last, he said, \u201cIt was me---\u201d\n\u201cWhaaa---?!\u201d Said the boys as they backed away with shocked, frightened faces.\nMr.Poppinstuff waved his mittens and said, \u201cNo, no, no!\u00a0That\u2019s not what I meant.\u00a0I mean it is my fault for your terrifying morning.\u00a0I misdelivered the package.\u00a0It should have gone to the Eddie that lives at 831 Maple Way.\u00a0He\u2019s a grizzly bear.\u201d\nThe boys stood like statues and gawped.\u00a0\nThen they all laughed.\nMr.Poppinstuff said, \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m not done for the night after all.\u00a0Would you care to accompany me?\u201d\nThe boys were so relieved, and enamored with the old guy, they said sure.\nMr.Poppinstuff said, \u201cHop in!\u201d\u00a0They did.\nThe badger whistled.\u00a0Two snow-white reindeer bounded out from the woods.\u00a0From behind the passenger\u2019s seat the boys shared, the badger pulled out a harness, complete with jingly jangly jingle bells.\nIn minutes, they were soaring over the white, sparkling land.\u00a0They headed north.\u00a0The ground was a blur with very few lights, soon, no lights at all.\u00a0They flew so fast, stars looked like comets.\nAt the North Pole they met Santa Claus.\u00a0He gave the mail-badger an identical package to Eddie\u2019s mistakenly delivered gift and another, smaller one with his name and address on it.\u00a0Correct and complete and sure this time."}
{"title": "'Tis The Season For Believin\u2019", "story": "\u00a0 \"Uncle Mike?\" Jake said while looking up from his soggy Cheerios. \n   Michael Remer peaked over the morning paper at his nephew. \"Yeah kid?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\"What does \n mean?\" he asked, balancing a spoonful of milk in mid-air.\u00a0\n \"Where did you hear that word?\" the tone of his question didn't match the chuckle he covered with his knuckles.\n   \"I heard mommy say that to daddy,\" he said, retreating back to his cereal. \"It's a bad word. Isn't it?\" \n\tMike's smirk turned to a frown as he closed the paper and laid it on the table. Removing his reading glasses, he exhaled through his nostrils while struggling to find a suitable explanation for a seven year-old.\n\t\nLook, Jake...\" Mike rubbed the stubble on his chin before continuing, \"Sometimes grown-ups say things they don't mean\u2013when they're angry.\"\u00a0\n\tThe comforting whiffed as his nephew remained submerged in the mini whirlpools he spun in his milk. \nThe innocent child playing with his cereal made his stomach flip. He had to cheer him up. \n\tUsing the wisdom of his additional twenty years of life experience, he dodged the subject by changing it to something universally loved by all children. \"But, Christmas is in a week! did you already send in your list to Santa?\" \n\t\"Luke Allen in my class says Santa isn't real.\" Jake said to his bowl. \n\t\n\t\"First off, don't ever trust someone with two first names,\" the joke landed as Jake's head emerged from the cereal with a smile. \t\n\t\"Secondly, if that were true, where do all the presents come from?\" \n\t\"He says they come from mommies and daddies.\" \n\t\"Hogwash!\" he snapped. \"There'll be no such lies in this house,\n!\" he added with an over the top pirate accent (a homage to Jake's fascination with the thieves of the sea). \n\tMike's goofy shouting caused the boy to snort with laughter. The wonder that exists in the hearts of every young child, returning to his face. \"Now, finish \n breakfast\u2013or \n be walkin' the plank! \n! \n!\" he said while scooping the paper back up and noticing the sports section. \"And y\n be joinin' the Red Sox, apparently\" he added with mild dissatisfaction and a raised eyebrow. Jake giggled, returning the spoon to milk with a scoop that overshadowed his mouth. \n \n\tAfter returning home from dropping off Jake at school, Mike called to check-in with his brother. \n\t\"How'd it go? he wasn't too much trouble was he?\" Richard Remer asked. \n\t\"He never is, Rick.\" Mike said. \n\t\"Good. Sorry to just drop that on you but we had to figure some stuff out. Stuff that couldn't wait.\" \n\tRick was that kind of guy. Everything was on his schedule and everyone else just had to work around it. \n. \n\t\"Yeah, how's it all going?\" \n\t\"Not great,\" Rick said through an exaggerated sigh. \"But, we're trying to work through it. You know, for Jake and all.\" \n\t\"That's noble. And now that you mention it\u2013I know it's not my place, but Jake told me this morning he overheard a fight. He said he heard Erin call you a\u2013\" \n\t\"You're right! it's not your place,\" Rick interrupted. \n\tMike could feel the heat coming through the receiver as he went on.\n\t\"What happens with \n family is \n business, got that?\"\n\t\"Understood.\" Mike said, choosing the one word answer over the more attractive spewing of hot truths that boiled in his gut. \n\t\"I know this hasn't been easy on him,\" Rick started to backpedal his emotions. \"I remember how hard it was on us.\" \n\t\n \n\t\"On top of everything, he's getting bullied at school now\u2013\" \n\t\"Wait, he's getting picked on?\" Mike's anger towards his brother morphed in a different direction upon hearing the news. \n\t\"Yeah, some kid starting teasing him about believing in Santa and what not. Got a few of the other kids to join in.\" \n\t\"Luke Allen?\" he spoke from seethed lips as he envisioned taking a trip to the Allen home and having a few choice words for Luke's parents. \n\t\"Did Jake mention it?\" Rick asked. \n\t\"Yeah, he sure did. I hope you gave that kid's parents a piece of your mind!\" \n\t\"Settle down. They're just boys. This stuff happens. Besides, it's probably time he learned the truth anyways.\" Rick said. \n\t\"He's seven, Rick.\" \n\t\"That's about the age I found out.\" \n\t\"Yeah and look how \n turned out.\" Mike immediately regretted the blurted out words. \n\t\"And what's that supposed to mean!\" Rick's temperature was rising again. \n\t\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean. I\u2013got a little worked up. I just don't think it's the right time to crush his\u2013\" \n\t\"Mike!\" Rick yelled above his younger brother. \n\t\"Fine, you're right. Your family, your call.\" Mike backed off. \n\t\"Good! sheesh, man. One day, you'll understand what it's like to be a father. Gotta make tough decisions.\" \n\tMike always hated his older brother's condescending lectures and this one was no different. Using the same technique that worked on his son earlier, he recycled the topic switcheroo method and said, \"Well, I'm still quite a few chapters away from getting to that one.\" \n\tRick belted a pack-a-day smoker's raspy laugh as he added, \"Yeah, you can't put the cart before the horse!\" \n\tMike tried to echo the expression but it came out flat and phony; Rick didn't seem to notice. Mike's love life was a long-running joke between the two of them (with one side enjoying the humor more than the other). \n\t\"But, in all seriousness,\" Rick paused to clear his throat with two coughs, before continuing, \"how's it goin' in the lady department? any prospects?\" \n\t\"Nah, work is so crazy right now. I can't even make time to watch a ball game, let alone try to date someone.\" \n\t\"Maybe you should ask Santa for one!\" Rick barely got the sentence out before unleashing another obnoxious wheezing howl. \n\t\"Ha, good one! But, I already wasted my wish this year on a cherry red Ferrari!\" Mike now joined his brother in laughter and this time it was genuine. \n\t\nThe doorbell in the distance lowered Mike's chuckles. With Rick still making a racket on the other end, his ear drifted from the phone. Tilting his head for improved listening, he waited for the reverberating ring to evaporate. Satisfied with the appropriate amount of silence, he started to turn back to the conversation.\n\t\n He sprung up from the kitchen table. \n\t\"Hey, Rick,\" he paused, waiting for his brother to die down. When it didn't, he interjected again but louder, \"Rick!\" \n\t\"Yeah?\" his roaring, having melted into the response. \n\t\"Someone's at my door. I'll have to call you back.\" \n\tHaving ended the call, he trotted down the stairs of his split-level home. As he reached the last step\u2013 \n \n\t\"I'm comin'!\" he yelled as he yanked at the handle, swinging the door open. \"What's so damn import\u2013\" \n\tThe porch was deserted. \n The only thing greeting him at the screen door window was the beginning of light flurries (which the weatherman on the radio this morning had assured wouldn't come until later this afternoon). \n Though, he didn't mind the snow. It had been a dry winter and he always enjoyed a white Christmas. Clicking the handle on the screen door with his palm, he started to push it open to take a step outside. But something was pushing back against him. After a second, he realized something was blocking the door. \n\tUpon further inspection, he found a small cardboard box sitting in front of the door. The box was maybe four inches tall and eight inches wide. There was a Christmas themed sticker on top. Red and green ornaments bordered the label that read, \"Mikey\" written in silver cursive. No other postage or stamps of any kind. This package was clearly delivered by hand, but it was very strange. No one had called him \n since he was a boy. \n\tHe stared at the box on the kitchen counter with crossed arms. Rubbing his chin, he pondered the package's possible contents and the reasoning behind the chosen name. He wasn't on a gift-giving level with any of his neighbors. His friends weren't exactly the \"thoughtful\" type; let alone think of a gift and hand deliver it. It seemed the only way to solve this mystery was with a rusting pair of kitchen scissors. \n\tThe flaps popped open as he finished slicing the lone layer of tape atop the package. Inside he found a blank envelope. Lifting the piece of paper revealed a small white box in the same rectangular shape as the package, only half the size. Intrigued, he unsealed the envelope and took out a tiny stack of white cards. The message's font on the first was bold and black, reading: \n \nOPEN ME IN THE GARAGE.\n \n\tConfused and visibly frightened, the card shook in his hand. \n Shrugging off the warning, he snatched the tiny box from the package. Tearing open one end; something rolled out and into his hand. It was a black HOT WHEELS toy car. Examining it closer, he recognized it was a Ferrari. \n\t\"Okay...\" he said, utterly baffled. \n\tHe placed the toy car back in the package. Setting his sights back on the cards, hoping for any further instructions that could explain the odd gift\u2013something caught his eye. \n He froze as his assumptions came to life. The package shook again. His body jumped back a step in response to the fear. Again, it shook; and then stopped. Gaining enough courage, he crept towards the package. It remained idle as he peered over the edge, grimacing with one eye closed. The tiny car sat inside, dormant. Suddenly, the sound of a jet engine ignited and the tires on the toy spun into action. Smoke started to spread through the kitchen as he feared his eardrums might explode from the reviving. Frantically, he went back to the cards in his hands. Over the tremendous growling of the package in front of him, he flipped to the second and last card. In the same font, it read:\n \n I TOLD YOU. THE GARAGE.\n \n \t\"Ahh!\" his shriek was embarrassing but justified. Acting on impulse, he gingerly grabbed the smoking package and turned for stairs. Scurrying down the steps, he carried the box as if it were a foul-smelling bag of trash. The two sets of stairs seemed more like ten. The blaring grew louder and louder, the closer he got to the garage. It was hard to tell through the smoke but it looked as though the car were growing. \n\tFinally, he reached the door. Wasting no time, he whipped it open and nearly ripped it out of its hinges. Tossing the ticking time bomb into his completely empty garage before he slammed the door shut. He dove back into the carpeting of his basement floor\u2013just as the reviving engine hit its crescendo. He curled into a ball and braced for the inevitable explosion. It never came. \n\tAfter a minute of heavy breathing, he sat up and listened. Silence. Making his way to the garage door, he tapped the handle. Expecting the metal to burn his fingers, he was surprised by its cool touch. Down by his feet he noticed a fog rolling from underneath the door. Taking a deep breath, he creaked the door open. Smoke transferred from garage to basement as he coughed and waved at it. After the combustion settled enough to make out the damage, his jaw dropped. Sitting in his garage was a sparkling new, black Ferrari. \t\t\n\tThe toy had grown into an \n automobile. Amazed and shocked, his feet floated towards the sports car. His hands slid across its welcoming metal body. He wasn't crazy. It was real! There was an actual Ferrari in his garage! \n\t\"Thank you! thank you!\" he yelled while hugging and kissing the car. \"Whoever you are! Thank you!\" Looking through the windows, he noticed something on the steering wheel. Sliding in the driver's side, he plopped into the warm leather. There was a card stuck in the center of the wheel. It was the same type of card he had found inside the package. In the familiar bold print, it said: \n \nMIKEY, YOUR HEART WAS RIGHT. JAKE NEEDS TO BELIEVE IN ME NOW, MORE THAN EVER. DON'T LET HIS MAGIC BURN OUT.\n \nP.S. I know you said cherry red, but this was the best I could manage on such short notice."}

Its fresh, piney green scent was intoxicating, the elves buried their faces in the soft needley boughs.\nThe elves giggled like squirrels, chattered like monkeys, and laughed like loons.\u00a0As the last of the lights were lit, and the last of the ornaments hung, the elves discussed the finale\u2026the decoration for the very tip-top.\u00a0The angel was white, with tinsel hair, pale blue gossamer wings, and a gown sparkling with sugary glitter.\u00a0She was nearly as tall as the largest elf, though made of paper and very light.\nA ladder would be of no use, on the highest rung of it, an elf\u2019s little arms wouldn\u2019t reach across to the treetop.\nIn a velvet blue coat lined with white fur, Sissy Snowflake put two fingers to the corner of her mouth and whistled to get everyone\u2019s attention.\u00a0Her shrill expulsion blew steam from her pink pointy ears.\u00a0As the colorful group of wee-folk quieted down, she asked them, \u201cAny new ideas this year?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not just get Santa or the Missus to do it?\u201d Asked Niftybuttons, pushing his eyeglasses up his tiny pug nose. Bits of peppermint candy and assorted cookies pelted the elf a second later.\n\u201cNot an option.\u00a0We do this on our own,\u201d Sissy said with her freckled nose in the air as if daring anyone to argue.\nA dark-haired elf in a lime green romper said, \u201cWe have had some disastrous attempts in the past\u2026\u201d\u00a0A murmur zig-zigged through the crowd as they recalled the previous three years.\nThe incident with the catapult had left Periwinkle missing her two front teeth, it had been painful watching her tackle her supper that night.\u00a0\nThe drone had flown straight into the top of the tree.\u00a0It was as if a whirring, spitting, buzzsaw had been let loose: branches disintegrated in an explosion of pine needles and tinsel, the poor tree had been decapitated.\nMarcipan\u2019s pet squirrel had been the most traumatizing.\u00a0It had been trained for a whole month to place the angel just so, and all had gone very well\u2026until the squirrel ate the angel\u2019s head.\u00a0It had previously been made from an acorn.\nJingleBob said, \u201cI think the Elf Ladder will work this year.\u00a0Look how big and strong JingleMel has grown\u2026\u201d The scrawny elf in moss green and yellow moved aside and his brother stepped up.\u00a0JingleMel was indeed a hulk of an elf.\u00a0In brown felt and fur, he looked more like a squat, roly-poly troll.\u00a0As if on cue, the Gingerspatzel twins leapt onto each of JingleMel\u2019s sturdy arms, they balanced on one foot each and bent like ballet dancers with toes extended, meeting over the burly elf\u2019s mop of dark curly hair.\nSissy tapped a finger against her pouty pink lips, \u201cHmm.\u00a0Yes, I concur.\u00a0This year the Elf Ladder will work just fine.\u201d\nThe wee folk bounced over to the front of the tree, clapping and shouting, \u201cMe, me me!\u201d In high pitched voices like happy blue jays.\nSissy strutted back and forth in front of them, pointing and saying, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026you\u201d like a judge at the American Kennel Club.\u00a0She stopped when she had twenty of them, lined up from the biggest- JingleMel, to the smallest- Urchinpoo, an elf of Asian descent, with dark, almond shaped eyes peeking from amidst a froth of pale pink marabou scarves. Her voice was one of a tiny mouse, \"Yay!\" She squeaked.\n\u201cTwenty should do it.\u00a0Places everyone!\u201d Sissy shouted.\nOne by one, the elves assembled, each smaller than the one before it, each climbing onto the shoulders of the elf under it.\u00a0As Urchinpoo climbed the nineteen feet to the top, her understudy, a tiny thing in lavender named Periwinkle, rooted her on.\u00a0She was frightened of heights and did not want to climb the Elf Ladder.\u00a0\nThe ladder swayed as a center elf\u2019s foot slipped from the shoulder beneath him.\u00a0The crowd \u201cOoooohed.\u201d\u00a0Then \u201cAaaahed\u201d as the line straightened back out.\u00a0At the top, Urchinpoo regained her own footing, and the paper angel was passed along and up, in her direction.\nSissy inspected the symmetry and balance of the tree.\u00a0She was mesmerized by the soft golden lighting and gently wafting strands of old-fashioned tinsel.\nA cacophony of squeals and cries broke her trance.\nShe yelled, \u201cIs anyone hurt?!\u201d To the tumble of elves before the tree.\nThey were getting to their feet and rubbing bruised bums and elbows and knees.\u00a0\nPeriwinkle exclaimed, \u201cWhere\u2019s Urchinpoo?!\u201d The elves looked around, and as they spread out, it was clear the mini pink puffball was not amongst them.\u00a0They looked under the low-lying branches and ran about calling her name.\u00a0She was not anywhere in the house either.\nShe had simply vanished.\nThat night at the long supper table, forty-eight elves sat, with Santa at one end and his Missus at the other.\u00a0They picked at their food and occasionally started conversation that petered out quickly as eyes inevitably wandered to the empty seat three down from Mrs. Klaus\u2019 left.\nSissy Felt especially awful.\u00a0She was the unofficial leader of the elves pretty much, only because of her outspoken, bossy nature and felt responsible for each one.\u00a0At the time of the disappearance, she had decided that Urchinpoo had to be playing a prank.\u00a0Now, here in the dining room, the elves looked to her for answers, solutions, a game plan perhaps.\nSanta, king of the elves, said, \u201cSissy Snowflake.\u00a0Have you any clues?\u00a0Any progress?\u201d\nPut on the spot, she suddenly didn\u2019t want the attention, for she had no answers.\u00a0She hung her pretty head sadly.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, in any case, we still need to complete the tree decoration.\u201d Santa said.\nAfter supper, the courtyard lanterns were lit, infusing the darkness with welcoming mellow light.\u00a0A thousand Christmas lights reflected off the fresh snow, it sparkled as if sprinkled with colorful glitter.\nThe elves formed their Elf Ladder with little merriment, little Periwinkle shook with fright as she ascended the tower.\u00a0Third from the bottom, Boysenberry sneezed.\u00a0A sneeze could take down the whole lot\u2026they swayed to the left and right, then straightened up solidly.\u00a0Whew.\nCuppy Gingerspatzel was the elf at the top. As Periwinkle cautiously climbed her shoulders, Cuppy whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Peri, just don\u2019t look down.\u201d\nPeriwinkle had not dared to look down\u2026until then.\nThe tower shuddered as Periwinkle lost her footing.\u00a0Cuppy yelled, \u201cElf down!\u201d\nSissy had been watching the procession but had taken her eyes off the tiny, purpley elf when Boysenberry had sneezed.\u00a0Now she scanned the ground and the tree branches.\u00a0She called up to Cuppy, \u201cWhat do you mean?!\u00a0No one fell!\u201d\nCuppy replied, \u201cWell, she was here for a second!\u00a0Now, she\u2019s not!\u00a0She must have fallen!\u201d\nThe elves disassembled and searched the courtyard for the lavender cloaked elf.\nRolly Garopollo and JingleMel wheeled out the catapult from the garage.\u00a0Sissy rolled her eyes and muttered, \u201cWhy not.\u201d\u00a0She stepped aside, watching the foot high wheels turn\u2026 \u201dWait!\u201d She cried.\u00a0The catapult was just about to roll over something small and shiny half buried in the snow.\u00a0A button.\u00a0A purple one.\nAgain, it seemed, an elf vanished into thin air.\nCuppy\u2019s sister, Cooperfield, climbed up the catapult and planted herself excitedly in the cup.\u00a0She wore a wooden helmet over her bright copper-colored curls, only her large brown eyes peeked out.\u00a0JingleBob passed her the paper angel then positioned himself, ready to press the release lever.\u00a0\nSissy said, \u201cOn one, two\u2026three!\u201d\n\u2018Sawiiiiiissssshhhh!\u2019 Flew Cooperfield through the frosty air, she cried, \u201cWheeeeeee---\u201d Her voice cut off as she disappeared amidst the branches.\u00a0The paper angel drifted down, see-sawing back and forth, wings fluttering as if she were trying to fly, like a baby bird falling too soon from its nest.\u00a0JingleMel opened his arms and caught it, cradling it gently.\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d Said Sissy, blinking.\u00a0\n\u201cDid you see that?!\u201d JingleBob exclaimed, \u201cShe\u2019s disappeared!\u201d\nCuppy said, \u201cShe must be in the tree!\u00a0I\u2019m going in after her!\u201d\nSissy held her back and said, \u201csomething strange is going on here.\u00a0I can\u2019t let you go in.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u00a0Let me help you look.\u201d\nCuppy nodded and Sissy called the biggest elves over.\u00a0She needed them to tip the tree and lay it down on the ground.\u00a0Rayray Goodcandy and his brother Bobo joined JingleMel and JingleBob.\u00a0\nSissy studied the Goodcandy brothers\u2019 faces for ten full seconds, then narrowed her eyes and furrowed her brows.\u00a0She asked them, \u201cWhen you cut this tree down yesterday, where did you get if from?\u201d\nThe Goodcandys looked at each other, Rayray sheepishly said, \u201cThe north woods\u2026\u201d\nSissy persisted, \u201cWhich north woods?\u201d\nBobo said defensively, \u201cIt\u2019s the best tree ever!\u00a0We found a FOREST of perfect Christmas trees!\u201d\n\u201cJust a little further than we normally go.\u201d Added Rayray.\nSissy said, \u201cYou crossed the Red Field!\u201d\n\u201cIt was no big deal,\u201d said Bobo.\n\u201cdon\u2019t get what all the fuss is about,\u201d said Rayray.\n\u201cthe chocolate was amazing.\u201d said Bobo.\nBy now all the elves had gathered and were standing around the three with their mouths open and their eyes big as ping pong balls.\nSissy, exasperated, said, \u201cSanta made a deal with the Red Wizard who lives in the Far North Woods.\u00a0We don\u2019t cross his field, we stay out of his forest.\u00a0In return, he doesn\u2019t eat us\u2026wait\u2026what chocolate?\u201d\nRayray said, \u201cWe found chocolate,\u201d\nBobo said, \u201cin the field,\u201d\n\u201clike someone had dropped it.\"\n\u201cA trail,\u201d\n\u201cinto the woods.\u201d\nSissy exasperatedly looked from brother to brother.\u00a0\u201cYou Ninnyheads!\u00a0The wizard must have wanted you to cut down this tree!\u00a0Through the tree he\u2019s swiping elves!\u00a0Poor Poo, and Coop, and Peri.\u00a0They\u2019ve surely been eaten.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go and rescue them!\" Said Bobo.\n\u201cSanta can help...\" said Rayray.\nSissy cried, \u201cSanta cannot hear of this!\u00a0He will be furious that we broke the oath.\u201d\n\u201cWe can go through the tree,\" said Bobo.\n\u201cjust like---\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d screamed Sissy, \u201cWe\u2019ll be eaten too!\u00a0We must go the long way, over the field.\u00a0You will have to show me exactly which way you went.\u201d\nThe three elves headed to the Red Field at midnight.\u00a0The night was crystal clear, the stars twinkled merrily, and the moon a lantern that led their way.\u00a0It was pretty as a Christmas card. Although two feet of snow had fallen since the boys last trip across the field, it was easy to see the ditch that the tree had made as the brothers dragged it home.\nSissy grew increasingly nervous. Halfway across, she stopped walking and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve figured out what\u2019s so creepy\u2026there\u2019s no sound.\u201d\nThe Goodcandys stopped and cocked their heads like terriers listening for the crinkle of a can opener opening a can.\u00a0Rayray said, \u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d\n\u201cno owls, no wolves,\u201d\n\u201cno crickets, no night-jays\u2026\u201d\nA howl arose from the woods ahead of them and east.\u00a0HIS woods.\u00a0It was unlike any sound the three had ever heard.\u00a0It was similar to a wolf\u2019s but more guttural, higher pitched, and a hundred percent menacing.\u00a0Sissy felt every hair on her body stand up and quiver.\u00a0She held her belly to quiet the roiling worms in it.\u00a0The boys did the same.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be out in the open like this.\u00a0C\u2019mon!\u201d\u00a0She started running, the boys ran too.\nThe elves\u2019 tiny feet blurred over the glistening, blueish white expanse, so swift and light, they left no footprints. They reached the far side in two minutes. They leapt into the woods and crouched behind a tree as the eerie howl rose again, closer this time.\nCautiously, they continued through the forbidden forest.\u00a0It was not entirely silent anymore.\u00a0Branches behind them snapped.\u00a0Snow clumps \u2018\n\u2019 as they fell from tree limbs. And deep, ragged breathing trailed their path.\nAs the thing grew closer, they heard heavy, crumping footfalls and strange slurping noises.\nLights ahead twinkled through the trees ahead!\nThere, deep in the Red Wizard\u2019s Forest, was a castle.\u00a0It was house-sized but a bona fide castle, nonetheless, complete with two towers with pointed, cone roofs, wide gables over the first story windows, and a drawbridge over a frozen moat.\u00a0It appeared to be white frosted glass with blue crystals embedded all over.\u00a0The moonlit, sparkling reflections made it appear to be alive and breathing even though the multipaned windows were dark.\nThey circled the castle and around the back they found a maple tree by the shiny silver moat.\n\u201cC\u2019mon said Sissy.\u00a0She went to the tree and put her hands together like a step.\u00a0Bobo stepped up and on to her shoulders.\u00a0Rayray did the same to form an Elf Ladder.\u00a0Rayray leapt upwards and caught the lowest bare branch.\u00a0Then he pulled Bobo up, who pulled Sissy next.\nWhen they had climbed twenty feet up, they could see into the backyard of the sparkling castle home.\n\u201cToss me over the wall,\u201d said Sissy.\nBobo hung by his feet and took her hands in his.\u00a0He rocked like a swing, back and forth.\u00a0When he swung towards the wall, he let go of Sissy\u2019s hands at the apex.\u00a0She made her body long like Superman and flew over the wall.\nShe rolled in a ball across the yard then raced to the backdoor.\u00a0Through the window she saw a cozy, dark kitchen. The door was unlocked.\u00a0Evil Wizards aren\u2019t afraid of anything.\nShe tip-toed across the cool tile floor, and stopped when she heard soft, whistley snoring.\u00a0\u2018Periwinkle!\u2019 She thought.\u00a0For even though the dentist had crafted new teeth, she\u2019d snored ever since the accident.\nBehind the kitchen door, Sissy found the cage.\u00a0\nHer three little friends were curled up in blankets.\u00a0There was a bowl with a few chocolates and a candy cane in it, and another half full of milk. She thought, \u2018It\u2019s as if they are pets.\u2019\nShe rattled the metal door and called out softly, \u201cPeri!\u00a0Cooper!\u00a0Urchinpoo!\u00a0Wake up!\u201d\n\u201cWhaaa?\u201d said one of the girls.\nSuddenly the kitchen was flooded with brilliant white light!\nAll four elves blinked and squinted in surprise.\n\u201cAha!\u201d\u00a0shouted the wizard.\u00a0\u201cA trespasser!\u00a0I shall add you to my collection!\u201d\nSissy thought, \u2018That sure doesn\u2019t sound like an evil wizards voice\u2026\u2019\nShe turned around and saw\u2026\u2019a miniature wizard?\u2019\nIt was indeed a child.\u00a0In purple pajamas with stars and planets all over them.\u00a0On his head was a tall, pointed hat in a matching pattern.\u00a0He wore fuzzy purple bunny slippers.\n\u201cInto the cage you go!\u201d cried the boy.\u00a0He was three times her size, but she shook her head, refusing to move to the cage.\u00a0He opened the cage door and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get into the cage, my grandfather will eat you!\u201d\n\u201cHa ha ha!\u00a0Who says I eat elves?\u201d A voice boomed from the doorway.\u00a0The tall, white-haired old wizard came into the kitchen, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s all the ruckus?\u201d\u00a0He resembled a taller, thinner Santa, but wore a velvet robe so black it sucked in light.\u00a0He looked angry, his eyes shot red sparks.\nNow, she was scared.\n\u201cAh Granpoppa.\u00a0This one refuses to get in the cage.\u201d\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t blame her.\u201d\u00a0To Sissy he said, \u201cYou elves have broken the two-hundred-year oath.\u00a0You are now mine to do what I like with.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a terrible mistake!\u00a0The two that cut down your elf-eating tree were lured into your forest by chocolate. They\u2026WE\u2026are very truly sorry and will do anything to make it up to you.\u201d\n\u201cGranpoppa, you can\u2019t let them go!\u00a0They\u2019re my pets!\u201d\nSissy understood then, that the child was simply lonely.\u00a0Wizards were infamously known for being recluses.\u00a0This poor child simply wanted playmates.\nThe old scary wizard looked at the boy wizard and said, \u201cIs that true Sefton?\u00a0You lured the elves into my forest with chocolate?\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s eyes filled with tears.\u00a0He nodded.\nThe wizard\u2019s face broke into a grin.\u00a0He went from scary monster to cheery fun uncle.\u00a0He said, \u201cWell, then this is just as much your fault as it is the elves.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t send them away.\u201d Sefton\u2019s small voice quavered.\nSissy said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over and play with us?\u201d\nSefton looked up.\u00a0He sniffled and wiped his eyes with his sleeve.\u00a0He looked at his grandfather and said, \u201cCan I?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s odd for a wizard to want to be around other beings\u2026\u201d He shuddered and continued, \u201c\u2026but I can\u2019t see any harm in it if it makes you happy.\u201d\n\u201cOh boy!\u00a0Friends!\u201d\u00a0The young wizard clapped with joy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get home now, before Santa wakes up, he\u2019ll be very worried to find three more elves missing.\u201d\n\u201cThree?\u201d asked the big wizard.\n\u201cOh!\u00a0Yes, my friends are out in that maple tree, waiting for us.\u201d\n\u201cTo get back, you will have to go through the tree-portal.\u00a0The zombie wolverine that guards the woods is quite fearsome.\u201d\nSefton threw a rope ladder over the wall, the Goodcandy boys climbed over.\u00a0The sky was pinking with a new dawning day.\u00a0There was a tree in the castle yard, identical to the elves\u2019 tree but with fewer decorations, and little tinsel.\u00a0The tall wizard stood on a wooden ladder and one by one, the elves were tossed into the tree.\u00a0\nAn hour later, they came back through the tree.\nWhen young Sefton, the mini-wizard, came out to meet his new friends he saw that his own Christmas tree was now sparkling with tinsel, covered in twinkling lights, and at the tip-top sat a beautiful paper angel."}
{"title": "Lightless", "story": "I can\u2019t sleep. Sometimes sleep won\u2019t come to you. No matter what you do to catch it. No matter how hard you try. Sleep won\u2019t come. If Luna was there, she would probably tell me sleep is not something you can order around. She would tell me this, in that soothing voice of hers. That sleep never comes to the ones who wish to catch it. But Luna is not here.\n \n\t\nStill can\u2019t sleep. She would surely tell me a tale never to forget, which would instantly fade away. She would tell me about a flock of birds, flying far away from it all. Or about the snow, falling off and slithering through the stream. With every single word of hers, with every blink of my eyes, the world would fade a little further. I would leave my house. My street. My town. The clouds would get closer and closer, until what had once been the snow of her stories completely covered me. Until I flew with the flock of birds that she had told me so much about.\n\tRight when I would fight my hardest to fall back into my home and listen to her story, I would dream. I would jump from my world and land into a whole new one. The one where hopeful people live, when night strips the world from its light. Where love is born in a heartbeat, and beats all odds against it. The place where she would dance with more passion than her own shadow. But she\u2019s not here anymore. The stories are gone. The dreams are gone. And I can\u2019t sleep.\n \n\t\nScrew it. Shirt. Trousers. Shoes. Coat. Keys. Out. Leaving the house. Nothing left for me here in this sleepless night.\n\tI shut the door behind me and stare. Nothing but darkness ahead. No one - no sound. A naked, empty space. This is not my town. My town has people laughing in it. People living. My town has bright trees - trees that shake in the day\u2019s wind. My town is not silent or dark, and yet it is now. It looks nothing like in the pictures. In them, you can see everything clearly. Just the way it is. The way it has always been. The way it\u2019s supposed to be \u2013 lively, sunny. It doesn\u2019t even look like a painting. Any worthy painter would see this town and make it shine. Gorge the streets with light. Fill them with life.\n\tBut there\u2019s none of that here. Just fragments of what I know - pieces of a body. The church\u2019s door, but not its tower. The tree\u2019s trunk, but not its branches. The street\u2019s pavements, but not its people. The truth faded away. Now I\u2019m left with pieces of it all.\n \n \n\tThat\u2019s what Luna would have said, had she been there. But she isn\u2019t. I would have gone back inside. My mind wanted to. My legs, on the other hand, had an inexplicable urge. Hatable urge to walk the dimly lit streets ahead. So I did. Just me, walking, sleepless - out in the street - just me and the street lights.\n \nI like street lights. They\u2019re just like memories. They help you find your way when you\u2019re lost. Luna had always hated having street lights hanging around her. She used to say that they looked like stars in cages. In her mind, men needed to possess every possible thing and thought, to the point where they gripped the lights out of the sky to trap them. Down here, with us. \n Maybe she was right, in a way. It\u2019s not like she would see any stars shining in the sky tonight; if she was looking. Not like I can see them either. But there are street lights all over. What\u2019s the big difference, anyway? As long as there\u2019s light, there\u2019s sight.\n\tThere were a few stars left in the sky, when Luna was still here. We used to look at them from the top of our little hill. It was so small.\n \n\t\n.\n \n\tThat\u2019s how her words dragged you in. Every little thing seemed so much more complex, when you looked at it with Luna. Even the simplest of circles would start looking nebulous, if she stood next to you. The whole universe danced around you, when you went on that hill with her. So I did.\n\tShe used to say the silliest things. In the summer, when we sat on that hill together, she liked to speak to me about anything. Everything. The tree\u2019s leaves. She would ask what would happen if leaves could fly away instead of falling off the trees. \nWhenever she said those things, I would always react the same way. I used to look at her with confused eyes. That made her laugh.\n\t\u2018But leaves can\u2019t fly away.\u2019\u00a0I would argue. She would answer that they can\u2019t, except when they can. So I would keep disagreeing with her: \u2018But that\u2019s simply not possible. They have to fall at some point.\u2019 To that, she would answer in the calmest of voices that they did, except when they didn\u2019t.\n \n\t\nStill walking - walking and thinking. Leaves can\u2019t fly, Obviously. Yet I would stop arguing with her, because there was no point to it. There was no way of winning with Luna. Her words were not made of logic or sense. Her words were made of wonderful letters, combining in the strangest of ways. Entangled, not to form sentences, but to vibrate in the air. Those vibrations would move through the wind, the wind would touch a bird, the bird would fly and so would she; in a way. \n.\n\tHer mind always wandered to the strangest of places, that I understood nothing about. Places with no clear light showing her the way to go. Places where the light followed her, instead of her following the light.\n\tWhere her feet fell and met the ground, that\u2019s where a path would appear.\n\tIt was dark, in her mind - not a somber darkness, not an obscure one either - a darkness full of fragments floating around, dislocated from other pieces. Letters with no words, towns with no sun, leaves with no trees, birds flying away. \n.\n \n\t\nI would like to pretend that I hated her paradoxes, her illogicalness, her pieces of insanity. Even back then, sometimes I wanted to tell her that none of herself made any sense; but I never said that. I knew what she would say if I did, so we simply spoke through our gaze.\n\tNo matter how angry I would look, she always stayed calm. Her eyes would let their wing-like lashes bat for a moment; facing me, mesmerizing me. Right when she knew that I could no longer look away, her eyes would say \nThere was nothing I could answer, other than a smile. So I smiled - smiled and followed her with a light - into a whole new darkness.\n \nNow she\u2019s gone. And every step I once walked with her is filled with light, because I see it all so clearly - memories in my mind like stars in street lights. If she knew how much light there is in my mind where she once stood, she would look at me with her other gaze - not her charming, loving one, which made me feel like nothing else in the world mattered. Instead, she would stare into my eyes for just a moment, before looking away and never back at me. Guess that\u2019s the gaze she\u2019s giving me now.\n\tShe would have preferred to stay out of anyone\u2019s sight - like a wild animal, that everyone wishes to see but that no one can get close to. A subtle, mythical creature. One which hid behind the clouds, yet shone through them. A fantastical phoenix, flying far away from reality, failing to face a fading future. \n.\n\tEven if I remember everything, every single moment with her - even if I flooded all of them with light. Even then, she still won. No matter how many pieces I try adding together, she still makes no sense to me. As I am thinking about it all, she still escapes the light surrounding her. It could never quite catch her. It never will. Luna, the one girl beyond reason, beyond meaning, beyond light.\n\tShe never wanted to catch me in return. That might be the most painful part of it. She wanted me to be free, all I wanted was to be hers. I ended up belonging to no one. Just like her. What does that make me? A person, an animal? An angel, a demon? He, she? I.\n\tI will never capture her the way I would have wanted to. She will never capture me because she would never want to. That shining darkness of hers slipped through my heart; like water through the fingers of a man, dying in the drought.\n\tIf I could go back in time and ask her one thing, then I would ask again: \u2018What do you mean, leaves that don\u2019t fall but fly?\u2019 I would shake her. Catch her unreachable shoulders and shake her. I would beg her until she would let me make sense of her world. A world that would not belong. That would simply be. A world where love still exists. A world where leaves fly away.\n \n\t5\nStill walking. Walking and remembering. There was a day - a sad day - one in which her eyes refused to meet mine. On that day, she said, \n She said that I should stop trying to grab everything. That I should let things fly away. But what sense does that make? If a leaf will fall, then it will fall. What difference will it make if I grab it beforehand? What difference does it make if I want it to be mine?\n\tNone of that matters, anyway. Because on the last day I saw Luna, on our very last goodbye, we stood next to a tree.\u00a0\n\tI can\u2019t quite remember what words she used on that day. My mind won\u2019t illuminate such a memory. All that its dim light can bring back is the voice that she spoke with. Her words weren\u2019t floating in the air and vibrating with the birds. Her words fell on me like leaves falling off branches; branches falling off trees, trees falling off the world. Everything fell \n.\n\tEvery soft snow flake was changed into an impetuous ice storm, every swinging leaf into a curled up memory of the fall,\n.\n\tAs she walked away from me - as she said her very last goodbye, in the harshest voice I had ever heard her utter - the last leaf fell from the tree. A bird took its place. Then more birds came along.\n\tThe ravens looked at me. They stared and hushed. Even they would not speak in presence of such misery. I stayed and stared back at them. Waiting. Not knowing what else to do. They curled up on themselves and left me \u2013 alone - with my thoughts.\n\tThey covered the tree. Perhaps out of sorrow - sorrow for what had fallen - what Luna would never let me catch. All of the leaves were dead at its feet and at mine. Lifeless. That\u2019s where she left me. Above death. I looked at the discolored leaves and they said nothing.\n\tOn that day, she pierced an ever growing hole within me - I sunk in it. Out of those beautiful snowy clouds, out of the sky with the flocks of birds, out of the lands where she stood in front of me. Back into my own street - my own house; right into a dark place\u2026 A somber darkness, An obscure one. One without the light of her eyes to guide me.\n \nThe lights in my mind bring me to her eyes once more. They were not clear, simple circles, her eyes - at least not when you focused on them and really, truly looked. They were nebulous. Like the edges of a grass-covered hill.\n\tThe gaze that she would give me whenever I was angry. The guilty gaze, which also spoke of love. The one which said \n I miss that gaze.\n\tMaybe she was right, after all. Maybe that was why I loved her. Her will never to get caught - to fly amidst the wind and storms. To be a leaf which falls \n - the small things. The sparkles of light in a sea of beautiful darkness; night sky, like the one slowly disappearing above me. It\u2019s strange to think that all which once made me feel complete is now the reason why I am so torn. Why I can\u2019t sleep.\n \n\t\nNumb. Empty. That\u2019s what you become when your heart gets ripped out of your chest. But then why can\u2019t I sleep? A hole doesn\u2019t look for sleep, so what makes me so different from it? Then again, a hole doesn\u2019t have needs. I need her. I need her world back into mine, I need to fall back into her land, into a long gone hope - sleep.\n\tI wish I could simply be mad at her. I wish I could blame her for what happened. But I can\u2019t, because every single one of my memories, every single light brings me back to her. In this ocean of sparkling stars, she is the moon.\n\tNow that she\u2019s gone, there\u2019s nothing left but that ocean\u2019s cold water and my little street lamps.\n\tIf I could do it all again, I would not ask her to explain things to me. If I could change anything, then I would beg for a leaf to fly. I would beg the wind to carry it up and never let it down. Never would I let my hands grab it. I would see the leaves fly in her world and love would be possible again. But it\u2019s not. And leaves fall. \n \n\t\nI keep on walking alone on this road. It makes more sense to me than she ever did. A road with light starting to dawn on it - A clear path. There are no turns or holes - It\u2019s perfectly perfect in every way. But then why do I wish it had spots and tree leaves falling on it?\n\tOut of my town. Not a single flaw on this, perfect, grey road. I see this road just the way it is. The way it has always been. The way it\u2019s supposed to be. Lively. Sunny.\n.\n\tI know which village this road will lead me to. The village will never move. Neither will my town. \n.\n \nI see the village from here already \u2013 perfectly perfect - just like this road. Why do I wish for its houses to be stained and its church to be crooked?\n\tI\u2019m on the clearest path, but that path leads me nowhere; nowhere that I care about. Not a place where leaves fly, just a place with perfectly perfect people.\n\tOnly the same old road I\u2019ve always known. What\u2019s the use of the same road when you want something new? This is not mid-day, this is dawn. I want a new path to walk down on. One which has never seen me before and one without any light.\n\tThat\u2019s when I saw it. On the side, hiding like a wild animal - probably full of wild animals. Another path. A flawed one; full of dirt, mud, grass. I would have stayed on the perfectly perfect road. My legs wanted to. My mind, on the other hand, had an inexplicable urge. unstoppable urge to walk the muddy path ahead. So I did. My feet; one after the other, plunging out of the light and into a new darkness. Where my feet fell and met the ground, that\u2019s where a path would appear.\n\tThere\u2019s fog all over down here, snow-like fog, covering me, making everything blurry - nebulous. The dust illuminated by rays of new-born sunshine dash the only form of light present here. Stars, in a sky darkened by hundreds of naked branches. Perhaps that\u2019s just enough.\n\tLetting my eyes hop from one star to another, they fall at last on something else, new. A tree.\n\tThe tree trunk has freckles on it. Stained by time. Beautiful. I look up and see its crooked branches. Beautiful. At last, I see its leaves, black leaves, all over the tree. One of them moves a little with the wind, then agitates its wings, another starts croaking, and its leaf friend answers with some singing of its own. Bird-leaves.\n\tOne of the bird-leaves starts to move more than the others, and all of a sudden, it falls. I get ready to catch it, then stop myself.\n \n\tBefore crushing down, the leaf opens its wings and starts flying. All of the croaking and singing leaves leave, one by one, to a warmer place.\n \n\tLuna left me for a warmer place.\n \nI hope she found it.\u00a0\n \n\tPulling my hands back, I let my eyes stare. I watch. I just watch little birds leaving, little leaves leaving. As the last one soars through the sky, I see it. The leaf that flies and never falls. I see it and fall asleep. \n "}
{"title": "Ruby and the Rat", "story": "\tLong ago, on a day like so many before it, a distant clock tower chimed the hour. The sun rose, casting its radiant light over the snow-laden land. In a small shack on the edge of the village, the golden rays warmed Ruby\u2019s face. The young woman gripped her blanket, her one luxury, and snuggled her sleepy face into its warm embrace. The fire had died long ago and she held onto the warmth of her bed as long as possible in the cozy haze of dawn. She dared to open her eyes. The glistening snow shone beautifully outside, and the sun, nestled on the horizon, greeted her.\n\tRuby gasped, jumping to her feet. The cold floor on her bare skin shocked her awake but was not nearly as effective as the realization that she was, once again, late. She traded her nightgown for her dusty dress and ragged apron, threw her hair up with haste, and pulled on her bright red coat and boots as she stumbled out the door. Ruby flew over the snow toward the village. She followed the scent of fresh-baked cinnamon rolls and the clang of the blacksmith\u2019s hammer. Everyone in town loved Ruby and everyone knew she suffered from a bad case of tardiness.\u00a0\n\t\u201cLate again Ruby!\u201d chuckled the baker as she ran past. He tossed her a muffin, knowing she needed fuel for what lay ahead.\n\t\u201cThanks, Felix!\u201d Ruby called back, stuffing her mouth with the warm bread.\n\tShe passed the grocer, the blacksmith, the candlestick maker, waving with a smile at everyone as she went. The village sprang to life and the bustle began, but Ruby had no time to enjoy the liveliness. She wound around people, weaving through obstacles, and eventually ended up at the castle gardens. She slipped through the thick foliage and quietly sought out her secret hole in the back wall where she could sneak into the kitchens unnoticed. Just a row of hedges twice her heigh stood between her and the wall. She knelt down and crawled through the tangled branches when a tiny squeak caught her attention.\n\tShe paused a moment before continuing on, but the squeak once more found her ears. Snow soaked through her dress and froze her knees. Time urgently pushed her forward. But she stopped and looked around for the source of the squeak. Her eyes landed on a lump of mottled fur, barely hidden by the edge of the shrub. She eased forward and found a rat with a crooked tail, lame leg, and eyes full of sorrow. Her soul ached at the thought of the little guy\u2019s heart pumping furiously as he ran from a hawk. It had surely been a close duel, the rat barely escaping with his life. Ruby reasoned his chances were slim, but with proper care, he might just make it. She scooped him up, brushed the snow from his fur, and placed him gently in her apron pocket.\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long day ahead of us, but you\u2019re under my care now,\u201d she whispered as they squeezed through the stone wall.\u00a0\n\tThe kitchen\u2019s heat already sweltered as the staff hurried about cooking more food than could possibly be necessary. She blended in perfectly. Ruby hung her coat and went to work. She grabbed a handful of linens and headed to the queen\u2019s chambers. But not before placing a handful of nuts in her apron pocket.\n\tShe made the bed and rolled the old sheets to the laundry then moved on to dusting various trinkets before Princess Abigail found her.\n\t\u201cMother knows you were late again,\u201d the child sneered, her nose in the air.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Princess,\u201d Ruby bowed her head before the girl and quickly returned to work.\n\t\u201cMother also said apologies are worthless if you don\u2019t change your actions. Of course, \nnever have to apologize for anything. A princess is nothing short of perfect.\u201d\n\tRuby endured excess words from the queen and her daughter on a daily basis. She learned to ignore them and continue on. The slender child, clad in shiny jewels and frills turned dramatically and headed for the door. She left Ruby relieved for her early departure.\n\t\u201cOh,\u201d the child in the doorway\u2019s grin grew wide and wicked, \u201cMother said as punishment, you\u2019re to clean the chamber pots today!\u201d Princess Abigail giggled with malicious vigor all the way down the hallway.\n\tIn between tasks, Ruby would take the rat from her apron and wipe his fur. She\u2019d talk to him sweetly, and wrap him in scraps of warm cloth. She fed him the nuts from the kitchen and dubbed him Pistachio. Pistachio snuggled into her apron a rested well with a full stomach. He listened as Ruby endured verbal abuse from the castle\u2019s occupants. And he listened as she went about her work, singing merrily as she did. Room after room, she kept busy, worked diligently, while still finding time to tend to Pistachio. He admired how she made games out of her tasks and maintained a pleasant attitude.\u00a0\n\tAs the sun dipped low in the sky, Ruby tended to her last chore of the day: cleaning the queen\u2019s bath chamber. There\u2019d be clothes to take to the laundry, drain and scrub the clawfoot tub, then wrap up with mopping and watering the plants. She reached for the doorknob, but it opened before her. Queen Violet stepped out, draped in plum robes of velvet adorned with beautiful gold filigree. It was the only thing beautiful about her.\u00a0\n\tShe looked down on Ruby and spoke, \u201cYou better not be late another day, lest it be your last,\u201d she smirked and opened the door wide for Ruby to enter, \u201cI want this room spotless before you leave,\u201d she let out a chuckle accompanied by a snort. Her heels clicked down the hallway, the echoes marking her departure.\n\tRuby stepped into the room, her smile faded and shoulders slumped. Vases lay smashed and towels lay strewn about thoroughly soaked. Mud tracked across the floor and clung to the sides of the tub.\n\t\u201cWhat on earth happened here?\u201d Ruby sighed. Something ran into her shins, knocking her to her knees. She steady herself as something hot and wet slapped her face. Ruby raised her head to gaze into the amber eyes of the world\u2019s scruffiest dog. Her radiant smile instantly returned to her face.\n\t\u201cI bet you did this,\u201d she said stroking the puppy\u2019s damp fur. He looked at her expectantly, tail wagging furiously and tongue flopped to the side, \u201cHow am I supposed to clean all this with you running about?\u201d She posed the question to herself and scanned the room for a leash. Nothing. The puppy nosed her apron, sniffing it with curiosity. She pulled away, afraid the prodding snout might harm Pistacio. But the small rat popped his head up and sniffed the dog in return. He wrapped his tiny fingers around the edge of the pocket.\n\t\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Ruby asked.\n\tThe rat looked at her face in return and Ruby took the action as an answer. She scooped out Pistacio and his cloth and fashioned a bed for him on an end table. He burrowed back into the warmth before popping his head out ever so slightly. The puppy ran to the end table, skidding to a stop a mere inch before hitting it. He looked up eagerly at the rat but refused to bother him otherwise. Satisfied, Ruby set to work, face aglow with joy once more.\n\tNight fell long before Ruby completed her chores and left the castle behind, Pistachio in tow. Fresh snow fell from the silver speckled sky. She gripped her brilliantly colored, yet tattered coat tight and walked quickly. She passed through the village where most people already sat in their homes for dinner. The alabaster moon glistened off the snowy streets, and warm firelight glowed through frosted windows. Scents of meats and spices wafted on the air, and the tavern sounded alive with happy patrons. Ruby longed to take her time and enjoy the sights and smells, to join the people in the tavern and dance and sing. But the night was far too cold, and far too late.\n\tRuby reached her door to find a letter fixed to a ceramic pot. Inside she placed the items on her table and started a fire. Returning to the mystery package, she opened the letter. She instantly recognized the crude penmanship as belonging to Axlan the Blacksmith.\n \n\t\n\t\n\t\n \n \n\tRuby cherished the couple\u2019s kindness and fixed the pot over the fire to heat the delicious gift. She sat down to a delicious meal and every other spoonful of broth went to Pistachio. After dinner, she quickly tidied her room and tucked Pistachio into his cloth on her nightstand. She told the sleepy rat a short bedtime story before drifting off to sleep herself.\n \n\tThe next morning, the clocktower chimed in the distance. The sun once again beckoned Ruby to wake. Once again, she took a look outside and realized she was going to be late. With no time to snuggle under the covers and allow her body to gently rise, she sprang out of bed. She threw on her dress, her apron her socks with perfected ease. She grabbed her boots, her coat, and of course, Pistachio, and she raced out the door.\u00a0\n\tShe trotted down the path and onto the main road. As she passed through the village a curious sight befell her eyes. Not a soul trespassed the streets. The snow lay untouched, the forge stood cold, and the baker\u2019s ovens were bare. The sun rested low on the horizon. Ruby slowed down to examine the area.\u00a0\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is it possible I\u2019m early?\u201d\n\tShe pondered the thought, and though she was sure she rose from her bed late, what else could explain the sleeping town? A glance toward the clocktower confirmed her suspicions. Her concern abated, she continued to the castle. The guards stood at the gates, unwavering as always, but suspiciously still. Years had passed since Ruby last used the gates. She couldn\u2019t wait to see the surprise on her friends\u2019 faces when she arrived not late, but early. But as she entered the castle, the halls were, like the village, devoid of life. She checked the clock in the main hall. It read the exact same time as had the clocktower she spied minutes earlier. Perhaps it was broken. She moved from room to room and each clock read the same time as when she\u2019d passed through the village.\n\tPistachio crawled out from her apron and rested on her shoulder.\n\t\u201cOne clock could be broken, dear Pistachio. But every single one? Do you know what\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\tThe rate stared at her blankly and blinked.\n\tShe inhaled deeply and let out a long breath, \u201cWell,\u201d she thought for a moment, \u201cI still have work to do.\u201d\n\tRuby went about the rest of her day as usual. She took her time as she cleaned room after room, pausing every so often to play with or feed Pistachio. Though the silence caused her heart to grow lonely, she remained grateful that no one could speak harsh words to her or create extra messes for her to clean. When she completed her work, she packed up Pistachio and headed home. The village stood empty and pristine just as it had that morning. Ruby tried with all her might to squash a growing fear as she walked through the undisturbed streets. She fixed a simple meal for her and her rat before going to bed with the sun still peeking over the horizon.\n\tThe next morning Ruby awoke to the predawn darkness. She sat at the edge of her bed, thankful that at least the sun had moved. She took her time that morning, getting dressed with care and smoothing out her hair with a brush. She even made a modest breakfast. But as she searched for Pistachio, she found his makeshift bed empty. She searched under her bed, in her shoes, and behind her table, but the rat was nowhere to be found. Unwilling to waste the extra time she gained that day, she headed out for the castle alone. The clocktower chimed in the distance.\n\tAs she neared the village a large commotion drew her attention. Cheer gleamed on everyone\u2019s faces, and from scattered conversations, she learned the castle hosted a special guest. No one seemed aware of the previous day\u2019s conundrum.\n\t\u201cRuby!\u201d called Felix, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have picked a better day to be on time.\u201d\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d she inquired.\n\t\u201cA wizard traveled from far away to visit the castle today. They say he has a special gift. You should get going so you don\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\tFelix hurried Ruby along, slipping a sweet roll in her hand. The path bustled with people, all voraciously trying to find a place in the castle. Fortunately, Ruby had her secret entrance. She squeezed through the wall and into the kitchen. She fought through another throng of bodies on her way to the throne room. Ruby barely fit in the chamber full of raucous gossip. She twisted her way through the crowd to the side where she miraculously found a bucket to stand on. Looking over the crowd, she spied the mysterious stranger. Next to Queen Violet in her plum robes and Princess Abigail in her pink frills stood a tall, slender man. He wore a robe of midnight blue. Beady eyes poked out through his bushy, mottled hair and beard. Ruby thought something about the old man looked familiar as he popped pistachios into his mouth, though she was certain she\u2019d never laid eyes on him before.\n\tOnce the room filled with as many people as it could possibly hold, the queen stood up. Silence fell over the room and the woman began to speak.\n\t\u201cThank you all for gathering here today,\u201d Ruby rolled her eyes because the queen never thanked anyone for anything, but Queen Violet continued with false pleasantries, \u201cWe are honored to receive a very special guest, The Wizard Liri!\u201d\n\tThe old man pocketed the rest of his nuts and stepped forward.\n\t\u201cGood people, I am here today to bestow a gift on one your own,\u201d his voice boomed louder than anticipated, \u201cI will share my talents with one very special person today.\u201d\n\tThe room buzzed with murmurs of excitement. The Queen quieted the room once more, and not so subtly shifted her daughter closer to the wizard.\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve met someone who impressed me greatly with her attitude,\u201d he continued, \u201cher diligence,\u201d Princess Abigale stuck her nose high in the air, \u201cand her kindness. This young woman shall, from this day forward, be blessed with the ability to live her life sharing her goodwill with those who value her. And through her good fortune, she shall never want for anything again. \u201d\n\tPrincess Abigail snorted as confusion crossed her face. A princess, after all, already commands the attention of the people and is showered with everything she could ever want.\n\tLiri turned toward the queen, \u201cYour highness, in bestowing this gift that will help your entire kingdom, I ask one thing in return.\u201d\n\tQueen Violet, barely paying attention at this point said, \u201cOf course, what is it that you want?\u201d\n\t\u201cI only ask that this person be protected from anyone who would wish her harm.\u201d\n\tThe queen, believing her daughter the only likely candidate for such a gift, of course, agreed. A thin thread of shimmering magic flowed from The Wizard Liri\u2019s fingertips as he bound the queen to her promise.\n\t\u201cNow, Ruby, please step forward if you accept this offer.\u201d\n\tThe entire crowd erupted in surprised whispers. Surely he could not mean Ruby, the commoner who cleaned the rooms. Princess Abigail balled her fists and spun on her heels to glower at the wizard. But the room parted, clearing a way for Ruby. As she stepped forward on trembling legs, the villagers, who were all fond of her, softly congratulated her, patting her shoulder and offering kind words on her way.\u00a0\n\tShe stood before the old man, at a loss for words. She\u2019d never met this man before, how did he know her.\n\t\u201cRuby, do you promise to help your fellow villagers, to live your life spreading kindness and love?\u201d\n\tThe queen interrupted, \u201cThis is a joke right?\u201d Her shrill voice cut through the room, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d\n\tLiri ignored her and focused on Ruby.\n\t\u201cYes,\u201d Ruby whispered, \u201cBut, why me? What have I possibly done to deserve this?\u201d\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve seen how hard you work yet you ask for nothing. I\u2019ve watched you show kindness to even the smallest of creatures,\u201d he leaned in and whispered the next words so that only she could hear, \u201cHow did you know pistachios were my favorite?\u201d\n\tRuby gasped as she realized who stood before her. She threw her arms around the wizard, her tiny companion over the past two days, and hugged him. Pistachio had not disappeared after all, merely returned to his true self after she helped him heal.\n \n\tRuby lived her remaining days working for no one but herself. Day after day she used her magic to help those in her village however she could. And in the evenings she lived her life, enjoying her beautiful surroundings, sharing meals with her friends, and dancing in the tavern. She never again endured the harsh words of the queen and spread her natural light with everyone she met.\u00a0\n "}
{"title": "The Sleepy Clcok", "story": "Tic, Tic Tic, Tic.\u00a0The granular sound of each second passing was constant.\u00a0Laying on the unkempt sofa, dreaming of summer days when I was younger; I had my eyes closed to the world.\u00a0Tic, Tic, Tic.\u00a0The sombre rattlings of an old clock pierced my ears with the passing of each moment.\u00a0My time, however, was being spent in my imaginings.\u00a0The playful, days I spent at the creek, or simply rolling down what I thought at the time was a massive hill.\u00a0Going back years later, I realized the hill was nothing but a pile of dirt;

I am usually quite good at fantasizing in this particular spot.\u00a0Then it struck me, or perhaps stopped striking me.\u00a0The sound I cherished to help me in my dreaming endeavours, was no more.\u00a0Silence was what I was hearing.\u00a0My eyes still closed, I thought not of the past, but now of why I didn\u2019t hear my old clocks silky sounds.\u00a0Two things came to mind.\u00a0One, the batteries had died.\u00a0Which is a likely thing to happen.\u00a0The second, which I doubt, was that it had broken.\u00a0I fear not think of the second option, for sanitizes sake.\n \nReluctantly, I opened my tired eye and sat up to have a look.\u00a0The clock had indeed stopped.\u00a0That wasn\u2019t a shocking revelation, the sound missing was an enormous clue.\u00a0The slight irritation of something failing it\u2019s one task just seemed to a sense of melancholy.\u00a0I strolled over to the dresser drawer where I keep my spare AA\u2019s.\u00a0Got what I needed and went to the clock.\u00a0Bing-botta-boom, put the batteries in.\u00a0There was no change, the silence was still defining.\u00a0\u201cMy clock\u201d, I thought to myself.\u00a0\u201cMy clock is in-fact broken.\u201d.\u00a0Letting the dread sink in for a moment, I opened my mind to the possibility it was just a bad set of batteries.\u00a0So, in true delight I got some from my remote which I knew were good and tried those.\u00a0But then the dread came back when I saw there was no change.\u00a0A damper expression crossed my face, and the reality of my situation was cemented.\u00a0There was nothing left to do.\u00a0I had just utterly exhausted my abilities on fixing a broken clock, meagre as they were.\u00a0So, in true defeatist fashion, I decided to do something I can do quite well.\u00a0I decided to go to bed.\n \nStepping into my bedroom, I peered at the other clock I owned.\u00a0This one was my least favourite clock.\u00a0It didn\u2019t send me off into the most wondrous memories, but instead it bluntly woke me, \u2018the fuck up\u2019.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a thing I enjoyed, it\u2019s place in my home was one of pure necessity.\u00a0Like a smoke alarm or my ex who paid the rent, and it too was broken.\u00a0Well, when I say broken, I mean stopped.\u00a0Both my clocks were stopped, and at the same time.\u00a0I found this odd, and in a moment of curiosity I took out my phone to have a gander.\u00a0It wouldn\u2019t even turn on.\u00a0My home, which I honestly see as a refuge from the toils of the world, seems to have spitted me in some odd way.\u00a0I wasn\u2019t having it.\n \n\u201cKnock, Knock, Knock\u201d\n \n\u201cNow what?\u201d.\u00a0I thought, thinking of all the oddities this evening was bringing me.\u00a0I suppose another odd thing, like a late visitor, was not unexpected.\u00a0My aunt always told me bad things always happen in threes.\u00a0If the third thing wasn\u2019t this character stabbing me, I suppose I don\u2019t mind entertaining his presence and saying hello.\u00a0\u201cI could always ask him for the time.\u201d I thought in jest.\n \nOpening the door gingerly, I saw a fresh-faced and well-dressed man.\u00a0A thin cut dark suit, thin tie, polished leather shoes and a charming smile.\u00a0All-in-all, he seemed harmless and pleasant.\u00a0\u201cHello\u201d, he said.\u00a0His voice echoed with purpose and presence.\u00a0\u201cHello, how can I help you?\u00a0It\u2019s a little take if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d.\n \n\u201cIs it?\u201d, he replied.\u00a0Looking down at his watch.\u00a0Then tapping it a few times.\u00a0\u201cHuh, my watch must have stopped, what a funny thing to happen.\u201d.\u00a0Looking at him with an odd gaze a side, \u201cI actually just had my clocks stop as well.\u00a0That\u2019s a very peculiar coincidence.\u00a0But what is it you are selling?\u201d.\u00a0After I said this, he paused and looked a little more serious in his posture; like he was going to give a great speech to millions or sell one hell of a vacuum.\n \nHe then told me a fantastic tale.\u00a0Of how I was in fact on the couch still, at this very moment.\u00a0That my clock had simply stopped, and I fell asleep; dreaming of doing to bed.  He said, dreams seem real at times.  Our brains mistake them for whats true.  Ideally we can tell real from not.  But, our sanity is the cost.  \n \nI told him, where to go and closed the door quite hard.  \"I couldn't be dreaming could I\", I though.  Not while I'm very clearly awake and seeing so vividly the world around me.  I kind of wish he was selling a vacuum, at least then I'd have gotten an offer or something that was real.  \n \nAs soon as my mind wondered to idea he was correct however, I noticed how fluid things had gotten.  Like I was in control of reality, and not the other way around.  After a moment of realization, and contemplation.  I realized he was right I was in fact dreaming.  I had to be dreaming.  My girlfriend thought out that old clock and couch years ago.   \n \n \n "}
{"title": "A Quiet Kind of Magic", "story": "\tI startled at the whistle of my tea kettle. I was usually the only one making noise this late at night.\u00a0\n\tIt was my fourth Christmas alone since my grandmother had died. She was my mother and my father, and, for the most part, was one of the only people I ever really knew growing up. I missed her dearly.\n\tEvery Christmas Eve since I could remember, she and I would sit in the living room sipping on piping hot mugs of spiced black tea with orange slices. It\u2019s my favorite smell and my favorite memory.\n\tI walked into the kitchen and removed the kettle from the heat, letting it cool just slightly before pouring the water over a tea bag, cinnamon stick, and orange slice. As soon as it became fragrant, my grandmother was right there with me, I just knew it.\u00a0\n\t\u201cI love you, grandma,\u201d I whispered to her. \u201cMerry Christmas Eve.\u201d\n\tWhen the tea was finished steeping, I brought it into the living room along with a plate of fresh, buttery shortbread cookies and set them down on the floor. I plugged in my little Christmas tree -- only three feet tall -- and admired the way I always did. Never was my inner-child more alive than in this moment.\u00a0\n\tThe tree was simple: decorated only with the lights, silver tinsel, and some pinecones I collected in my yard. But it was enough. There were no presents beneath, and I was much too old for Santa to think to visit me anymore. \nI grinned at the silly thought.\u00a0\n\tI swirled around the last of the tea, now cold at the bottom of my cup, and finished it off, along with the last cookie. Sorry, Santa. As I stood to return my dishes to the kitchen, I swore I heard four swift knocks at my door. \u201cWhat on earth?\u201d I was certainly not expecting company. My one dear friend was a state away visiting her family. There was simply nobody it could have been. But I stole a glance out of the peep hole to be sure, and there was nobody. \u201cMaybe a branch or an icicle fell\u2026\u201d I turned around and as soon as I did, I heard it again!\u00a0\n\tQuickly, I opened the door to see who was there, but I was all alone. Snow was falling and my yard was covered in it, yet there were no footprints to be seen. A shimmer near my feet caught my eye, and there was a little package wrapped in brown paper and golden ribbon with this address on it. \u201cHow strange. There\u2019s no post today, and definitely not at night.\u201d I flipped on my porch light and swept over the yard once more, and there wasn\u2019t a trace of anybody else.\n\tI picked up the package and brought it inside, turning off the porch light and locking the door nice and tight behind me. I set my dirty dishes and the little box on my dining table and just stared at it. Curiosity had its grip on me, so I picked it up and gave it a little shake, like a child trying to guess what they got for Christmas. It was very light and the only sound it made was a soft metallic clink. I was not expecting a package and I was starting to feel a little spooked by the whole thing.\n\tLooking at it again, the handwriting matched my grandmother\u2019s quite a lot, but I obviously dismissed that notion. A lot of older women wrote in a similar way, as they were taught. I was flooded with a wave of emotion and nostalgia in spite of the logic.\n\tWith hesitation, I tore back the paper to reveal a small, pine box. Nothing spectacular. The wood was thin and honestly looked quite cheap. On one side, there was a latch that I flipped upward to open the box.\n\tI drew in a sharp breath when I saw the silver locket sitting on a small blue cushion inside. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d\n\tIt was a locket that I recognized immediately as belonging to my grandmother. She wore it often, but when she died, it was one item that I was never able to find among her things. Not in her bedside table or jewelry box or closet. I gave up on it, sadly. But there it was, sitting right in front of me after four years. It didn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0\n\tThe box contained nothing else, not even a note. Shivers ran down my spine while I tried to make sense of what was nothing short of a Christmas miracle.\n \nI took the locket and sat back down in the living room, beside the Christmas tree. I flipped it over in my hands and watched as the lights from the tree glistened and reflected off the surfaces of the locket and just sat there in that moment. In that incredible feeling. I felt like I should have been at least slightly afraid, but no. Nothing but calm and, well, wonder, surrounded me there.\u00a0\n\tGhosts aren\u2019t something I ever paid much mind to. I didn\u2019t believe or not believe. I just didn\u2019t think about those sorts of things. Yet, I was so sure that there was something beyond me that was making this happen. \u201cI love you, grandma,\u201d I whispered to nobody in particular.\n\tI looked up at the little clock that hung on my wall and noticed it was just a quarter after midnight, shortly after grandma and I would have gone to sleep. \nshe always told me. The last thing we did before huddling under the covers was sprinkle a few handful of oats across the front yard for the reindeer to graze on while Santa was busy doing his job. It was only fair. He got cookies, after all.\u00a0\n\tIt was late, and I was as tired as I was giddy from what just happened. So much so that I realized I hadn\u2019t even opened the locket.\u00a0\n\tMy fingers were trembling as I rotated it in my hands once more, finding the clasp. It snapped open in a split second and I swear I smelled cinnamon and orange as soon as it did. Inside was a small picture of who I clearly recognized as my grandmother, as well as a young man and a woman--who was holding a small baby, no older than a few weeks old. \u201cMom and Dad?\u201d\n\tThe trembling spread though my whole body as I found myself suddenly crying. I wiped my eyes. The tears blurred my vision but all I wanted to do was stare at this photo and this locket forever.\u00a0\n \nI slept on the floor of the living room that night. The glow of the Christmas tree was comforting and I felt as though I were being hugged all night. I was warm as the snow fell outside. I was happy and felt loved though I was the loneliest I had ever been.\n\tThe first sight of the sunrise woke me and I panicked searching for the locket. \u201cDid I dream that? I had to have dreamt that.\u201d But I didn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0\n\tI found composure when I felt the cold metal of the locket against my skin underneath my sweatshirt. Looking at the picture again, I smiled the most I probably ever did. I stood up and walked to the kitchen. I put my dishes from last night in the sink and filled the tea kettle to heat up. I dropped a tea bag into a new cup and realized that maybe I wasn\u2019t too old for Santa to think of me.\u00a0\n\t\u201cNext year, I\u2019ll put out the oats. I promise.\u201d\n "}
{"title": "Grampa Owl and Grandfather Mouse", "story": "\u201cMy father told me of the great massacre of Summer, 2020.\u201d Randolf\u2019s grandfather began.\u00a0\n\t\tRandolf looked over at his twelve siblings, they were all spitting images of Randolf- wee ash grey mice squatting comfortably like furry little pom-poms.\u00a0All twenty-four of their shiny black bead eyes were wide with raptness, Randolf joined them in their gaze towards the elderly, somewhat scruffy mouse with one torn ear and a kink in his tail.\n\t\tGrandfather mouse continued when he had all thirteen children\u2019s attention in full, he savored the dramatic pause, the flickering of the fire in the glowing hearth added dramatic shadows to the burrow walls.\n\t\tHe said, \u201cYes, the summer of 2020.\u00a0Like you little ones, I too, had had twelve siblings. We lived in a hollowed-out log that was part of the Johnson\u2019s cabin.\u00a0They started out as just a couple, the cabin their vacation home.\u00a0They came in the winter to do maintenance on the place, and at least once in the fall.\u00a0Sometimes they spent whole summers, sometimes just the weekends in the spring.\u00a0The human female was Rosie, her husband was Frank---\"\n\t\tSerafina said, \u201cHow did you find enough food to eat?\u201d\n\t\tGrandfather said, \u201cSince they did not live there year-round, my siblings and I were taught to value every crumb dropped, and every cake left unattended.\u00a0We stored enough during the visits to last us when the pantry contained only cans.\u201d\n\t\tThere was a collective \u2018grrrr\u2019 amongst the wee mice.\u00a0Cans were mean.\n\t\t\u201cThe couple had a baby.\u00a0And we feasted on a flood of tasty droppings.\u00a0The pantry was stocked with cereals and jars small enough to be pushed from shelves.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cWatch out for glass slivers!\u201d Exclaimed Randolf.\n\t\t\u201cThat\u2019s right Randy, you\u2019ve learned well\u2026 ummmm, where was I?\u201d\n\t\t\u201cYou were about to get to the part about the stinky man.\u201d\u00a0Said Serafina.\n\t\tRandolf added, \u201cYeah, the mean, rotten, crazy one!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cAh yes\u2026\n\t\tThere was a neighbor, through the woods, about an acre away.\u00a0He lived in the woods all year round.\u00a0The neighbor was a slob and a hoarder, his yard full of trash bags and Amazon boxes.\u00a0The man smelled of pee and stink and crazy.\u00a0The place would have been great for foraging except there were millions of rats, big mean ones.\u201d\nThe rapt grandchildren mice inhaled as one.\u00a0Rats were mean bullies, and cannibalistic.\u00a0The mice shivered.\n\t\t\u201cThe stinky man got a dog to catch the rats.\u00a0A young, big black lab.\u00a0The man starved the dog so it would be hungry enough to eat the rats.\u00a0It grew thinner and thinner, tied to a rope outside, never inside was it allowed.\u00a0It did indeed grow so hungry that it had to catch and eat rats---\u201d\n\t\tMillicent squeaked, \u201cGrampa, I thought dogs were mans best friend.\u00a0To be spoiled and cared for and loved\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\u201cYes, sweetheart, but you see, the stinky man was not right in the head.\u00a0That poor pup deserved so much better.\u00a0I started going over there daily.\u00a0Not to forage, there were still too many rats guarding the loot, but to check on the dog.\u00a0He had bald patches where fleas had wreaked havoc, his eyes oozed with infection, and his dull coat was like plastic wrap over pointy, knobby bones.\u201d\n\t\tRandolf\u2019s sisters wiped their eyes.\n\t\t\u201cOne day, the poor dog could barely lift its head.\u00a0He\u2019d given up waiting for a kind word or a loving hand.\u00a0His depression roiled off his emaciated body in sickly waves.\u00a0\nI had to do something.\u00a0\n\t\tI crept through the littered weeds as quietly as I could, to the dog.\u00a0He looked up at me, but I wasn\u2019t afraid.\u00a0After all the abuse, I saw kindness, still, in his glazed over, sad eyes.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cWhat did you do Grampa?\u201d asked William.\n\t\t\u201cWhat any decent creature would.\u00a0I chewed the rope.\u00a0It was thick, but it was rotting too, from being outside and all.\u00a0When the dog was free, I led him away from the fetid yard.\u00a0He followed me to Frank and Rosie\u2019s cabin.\u00a0The couple were appalled at the poor pup\u2019s condition.\n\t\tFrank had said, \u2018\n\t\tRosie had sobbed and said, \n\u2019\n\t\tFrank had said, \n\t\t\n\t\tFrank, Rosie, and the baby, named Josephine, took the dog to the town\u2019s vet.\n\t\tThe next day some men went to the stinky man\u2019s house and took him away.\u00a0The dog was brought back to the cabin.\u00a0My word!\u00a0He did not even look like the same pathetic creature from just two days earlier!\u00a0His coat was shiny, silky black and his wonderful kind eyes clear.\u00a0He had steak for supper that night and even given a name.\u00a0Jagger, named after some rock star, I believe.\u201d\n\t\tSherry said, \u201cThe Rolling Stones!\u00a0That\u2019s the band Rosie listens to when she\u2019s baking those yummy peanut butter cookies.\u201d\n\t\tAll the wee mice went \u201cMmmmmmmmmm.\u201d\n\t\tGrandfather Mouse continued, \u201cAll was good.\u00a0Everyone in the cabin was happy and healthy.\n\tThen, in the middle of summer, Frank built a barn.\u00a0A great big thing.\u00a0You see, the couple were talking of moving into the cabin full time.\u00a0Rosie was offered a teaching job at the elementary school, and Frank was going to restore old classic cars.\u00a0He\u2019d continue writing in his spare time.\n\t\tThe barn was rough wood boards, sturdy, and well insulated from the humidity and wet winter weather.\u00a0It was his workshop, four cars at a time would fit under its high, vaulted roof.\u00a0There were windows high under the eaves, to let in sunshine.\n\t\tAll was well, the change in plans was a win-win for all, including us mice.\u00a0Tasty droppings all year round. And dog kibble\u2026not as good as chocolate cake, but nutritious.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cEw, I don\u2019t like dog kibble.\u201d Randolf said and made a face.\n\t\t\u201cWell kiddo, you\u2019d eat it if you were very hungry.\u201d\n\t\tWilliam said, \u201cI like the liver treats the best!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cAs do I\u201d Grandfather mouse said, \u201cShall I go on?\u201d\n\t\tAll thirteen grandchildren mice squealed, \u201cOh yes!\u00a0Please!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cOkay\u2026so all was well and good.\u00a0Then the barn owls came.\u201d\n\t\tEight of the grandchildren mice cried, \u201cNo!\u201d The other five gasped.\n\t\t\u201cOh yes.\u00a0Huge pale birds with razor sharp talons and wicked curved beaks.\u00a0They swooped out of thin air like silent ghosts.\u00a0They were evil, \n things.\u00a0Sooo fast they were, by the time you saw them coming it was too late.\u00a0There were two of them. They\u2019re eyes were huge and rimmed with fire, nothing escaped their searching, keen, eyeballs.\u00a0The eyes of devils.\n\t\tEarly in the day, my mother and father went out to the yard.\u00a0They never came back.\u00a0Later we got thirsty, our parents weren\u2019t coming home, ever.\u00a0So, eight of my brothers and I fetched some fresh puddle water from the dripping garden hose.\u00a0I happened to look behind us and saw a shadow gliding over the yard, coming our way.\u00a0I said, \n\u2019\u00a0And us nine raced as fast as we could.\u00a0Not fast enough.\u00a0Four brothers were snatched from the right of me, the other four at the same time from my left.\u00a0The owl\u2019s banshee screeching nearly shattered my eardrums.\n\t\tWhen I made it to safety, into the drainpipe against the cabin, I looked up into the sky.\u00a0It was just getting dark; the two killers were pale fliers like airplanes in the purpling light.\u00a0I heard my siblings\u2019 death shrieks, high pitched and full of terror.\u00a0Each soaring killer had two wriggling mice in each wicked claw, Desmond and Dewey were pierced through their bellies but still screaming.\u00a0The nasty claws were dripping with my family\u2019s blood. The owls were laughing as they flew into the barn.\u00a0It had been madness we now call the \u2018Season of Slaughter.\u2019 Only my sister Sophie and I were left of our big happy family.\n\t\t\u201cGrandfather, we won\u2019t be able to sleep now.\u201d Said Randolf.\n\t\tGrandfather Mouse said, \u201cGo have your Granny Sophie make you some warm milk.\u201d\n***\n\t\tHigh in the rafters, in the nest of twigs and grass and soft green moss, an old barn owl with cataracts in his eyes and sparse tailfeathers sat on dry, cracked feet.\u00a0They\u2019d once been a healthy supple yellow, but with age had turned brown.\u00a0His head nodded down to his chest as his large golden eyes slid closed.\n\t\t\u201cGrampa, Grampa!\u00a0Wake up!\u00a0You have to finish the story!\u201d Cried a fluffball baby owl the color of cappuccino and milk.\u00a0\n\t\t\u201cYes, yes Caplan\u2026I\u2019m awake, just resting my tired ole eyes.\u00a0Where was I?\u201d\n\t\t\u201cJust getting to the Feast of August!\u201d cried wee Caplan, his heart shaped face eager for the climax of the story.\u00a0His eyes glittered with youth and joy.\n\t\t\u201cAh yes yes, the feast.\u00a0Let me see\u2026well, your parents had just been born, they were our only owlet kids.\u00a0They were voracious.\u00a0Always had their beaks open the minute we came in through the window or big barn doors.\u201d\n\t\tCaplan looked down at the big double doors, nearly the entire front wall disappeared when they were both open.\u00a0They had to be big, all those old cars had to fit through them.\u00a0The human male, Frank, did not park under the nest.\u00a0Simon felt badly for him but when you gotta go, you gotta go.\n\t\tGrampa Owl continued, \u201cThe day started out fine indeed.\u00a0We caught two of those stupid little mice, they live in the wall in the cabin and come outside to fetch water.\u00a0They are dumb, but very fast---\u201d\n\t\t\u201cAnd delicious!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cYes yes, mighty tasty, always been a favorite of mine.\u00a0Anyways, we snatched up two of them.\u00a0They were older mice, a little tougher than the young ones, must have been the parents.\u00a0We figured that was it for the day.\u00a0Then lo and behold, nine in the yard!\u00a0Fetching water.\u00a0I suppose they\u2019d gotten so thirsty when their parents didn\u2019t bring any home that morning.\u201d\n\t\tCaplan nodded vigorously, his mouth was watering, his shiny eyes glowing luminescent amber.\n\t\t\u201cYes yes, so, there they were.\u00a0Down by the garden hose, drinking from the puddle under it.\u00a0Your grandma and I were quiet as kites, soaring in the twilight sky.\u00a0We flew into the stars where the mice couldn\u2019t see us, but we could see them.\u00a0Oh yes yes, those were the days.\u00a0We could see for miles around---\u201d\n\t\t\u201cAnd even tiny mice far on the ground below\u2026\u201d\n\t\t\u201cYes yes, our famously great eyesight runs in the family.\u00a0So, there they were just lollygagging about\u2026when suddenly, the one in the middle looks up and behind him.\u00a0He spotted us and screamed.\u00a0Then they ran for the cabin as fast as they could.\u00a0They nearly got away, but I tucked in my wings like a bomber plane, and dove.\u00a0Your Granma Elsa did the same.\u00a0We were dropping to the earth at a million miles an hour!\u00a0\n\t\tJust atop those plump little mice, we spread our wings and soared back up\u2026each with two mice in each claw.\n\t\t\u201cWow.\u00a0That\u2019s so cool.\u00a0Eleven in one day.\u00a0Eight at one time is legendary!\u201d\n***\n\t\tFrank\u2019s honey colored workbench top was warm and polished by years of hand rubbed care and cleaning with an oily wood polish.\u00a0It was scarred and chipped and smelled of the citrusy solution.\u00a0A row of six red metal toolboxes lined the wall behind the bench.\u00a0There were mugs and a collection of vintage steins holding paintbrushes and drafting pencils and small office tools.\n\t\t\n\u2019 Thought the barn owl as it landed clumsily on the smooth cement floor.\u00a0\u2018\n\t\tThe old barn owl hobbled over to where the old mouse sat, nibbling a tiny crumb from Frank\u2019s lunchtime sandwich.\u00a0It was yellow with mustard and smelled of ham.\u00a0\n\t\tThe mouse looked up and said, \u201cI heard you telling your grandkid about the Season of Slaughter---\u201d\n\t\t\u201cHa ha, you mean the \u2018\n of August\u2019.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\t\t\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll eat you now?\u201d\n\t\t\u201cYou won\u2019t get the chance.\u201d\n\t\tThe old owl was crumply with age, his bones creaky with arthritis.\u00a0But he still believed mice were stupid.\u00a0He lunged towards the old, nearly white mouse.\u00a0The mouse was as old as the owl but had always been faster on the ground, he scootched backwards in a blur as the huge black dog caught the owl in his frosty colored jaws.\n\t\tHigh in the rafters, a young barn owl screeched in distress."}
{"title": "Summoned", "story": "Tom said, \u201cThank you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo. Not sarcastic. How do I make it sincere\u2026? I thank you!\u201d He stamped his foot. \u201cTo what can I\u2026 Keep it simple. How can I thank you\u2026? Too tentative. Mean it. I\u2019m honored\u2026\u201d He hissed in frustration. \u201cThis is a one shot deal. Thank YOU. THANK you. THANK YOU\u2026 No! No!\u201d \nHe stopped walking and looked about. The road stretched for miles. Tom Legato couldn\u2019t afford transportation. He walked alone. He was a simple cat. \u2018\n \nThe occasional carriage rattled by, stirring up dust and making Tom sneeze. \u2018\n\u2019 he thought. He called out, \u201cI\u2019m summoned by the king! You\u2019ll respect me then!\u201d He would have shaken his fist at them, if he had one. He moved his paw, as if to scratch the receding carriage. It wasn\u2019t the same. \nLiving by his wits, he had little to show for his efforts. But that\u2019s not to say he wasn\u2019t smart. Did any cat rest on the fortune he acquired? For most, it is paw to mouth subsistence. Cats don\u2019t hoard. They have little use for savings accounts. \u2018\n\u2019 \nCalled by the king, Tom could not refuse. The letter included an invitation for the banquet planned in his honor. \n\u2018\n\u2019 Tom felt unworthy of any credit. He\u2019d never accomplished anything. Let alone anything good. \u2018\n\u2019\n\u2018\n Even a discount coupon at Walt\u2019s Fish House, from the king, would have incalculable value. He couldn\u2019t use it. Its worth would surpass the best market catfish. \u2018\n\u2019\nTom shook his head as if awakening from a dream. \u2018\nHe shuddered, \n\u2019 But he was an empty vessel. \n\u2019 A cat may have only his dignity, but he holds that dear.\nBut the king called him. Tom had a letter, bearing the king\u2019s signet, his signature and seal. He would present it to the guard at the castle gate. They\u2019d take him seriously. Then everyone would see what happened.\nAnd he couldn\u2019t be late. It won\u2019t do to keep the king waiting. Tom walked. Dawdling wouldn\u2019t hasten the journey.\nTom approached a bridge over the river. \n he thought.\nA scream followed by a splash, drew his attention. Jumping atop the wall, he saw a young man floundering. Obviously unable to swim, he bobbed away in the swift current. \nTom scampered downstream and onto a Sycamore branch leaning over the river. Taking a firm grip, Tom lowered himself over the water. \n\u201cHey! You! Grab my tail! Save yourself!\u201d\u00a0\nThe youth responded. He lunged and grabbed Tom\u2019s tail before the rapids carried him off. \nPain surged through Tom as the strain almost pulled him loose. \n\u201cHold on!\u201d\nPaw over paw, working his way toward the shore, Tom sunk his claws deep into the bark. Soon the young man felt the sand beneath his feet and released Tom\u2019s tail. He splashed ashore and knelt in the mud to catch his breath. \nTom pulled himself up, made his way to dry land and stood by. \nThe man saw Tom and let out a huge sigh. \n\u201cYou saved me! How can I ever thank you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have done the same for me, if you had a tail.\u201d They laughed. \u201cWere the current any stronger, you\u2019d have had mine.\u201d\nHe stood and bowed. \u201cI\u2019m Oliver. At your service.\u201d\nTom introduced himself and showed Oliver the king\u2019s summons. \nOliver read it carefully. \u201cWow! The king is entrusting you with the \u2018Order of the Felon?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018feline,\u2019 dolt! Feline!\u201d\n\u201cRight. Of course\u2026 Sorry.\u201d\nTom said, \u201cSince you\u2019re wet, and I\u2019m hungry, catch us a snack?\u201d\nOliver nodded but hesitated. \n\u201cYou about pulled my tail off. Provide sustenance. Or you druthers be bait?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d\nTom rolled his eyes. \u201cMake a fire. I\u2019ll see to it.\u201d\nChastened, Oliver prepared a fire. \nSoon, Tom returned. \u201cCatfish!\u201d\nWhile they ate, Tom explained his quandary. \n\u201cHow does one show appreciation for a gift? From a king, no less. It\u2019s unearned favor. Can\u2019t buy it. Can\u2019t earn it. I\u2019m a cat, completely, utterly unworthy. Attempting to pay, by any means, for the recognition, is a fool\u2019s errand. Would I insult the king? But for what will I be recognized? What distinguishes me from any other cat?\u201d\nOliver nodded and wiped his mouth.\n\u201cI need to express the obligatory thank you, without sounding obsequious, do you follow?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any salt?\u201d\nTom ignored him. \u201cI must tell the king he\u2019s mistaken. But how does anyone, let alone a cat, correct a king? Kings don\u2019t suffer fools. How will he respond to an impertinent cat? Sounds like a formula for unthinkable punishments.\u201d \n\u201cValet for a mischief of rats, or worse.\u201d\nTom pushed his dinner away and stood.\n\u201cWe must be on. The sun sinks. Arrive by nightfall, or never. Perhaps you\u2019ll lend me a perch on your shoulder?\u201d\nOliver hoisted Tom up and they left. \nThe cat continued his musings. \u201cI can see the headlines. \u2018\n\u2019 Already, a non-entity, I\u2019ll become persona non grata. The best known nobody in the kingdom. Other cats would stiffen their tails at me. In no alley in the kingdom, could I twitch my whiskers.\u201d \nOliver chuckled, \u201cRats would blow raspberries at you.\u201d \nTom refused to acknowledge the thought. \u201cI see no way out of this. How can I respond worthily?\u201d\nOliver said, \u201cWorthily? Meaning\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cDesiring worth\u2026 Sincerely willing, but lacking that virtue\u2026 acting as if\u2026\u201d\nOliver nodded.\n\u201cCan one undo his meagre worthiness? Is cultivating unworthiness ever a useful strategy?\u201d\nOliver pointed. The castle loomed in the distance. A flock of sheep grazed on a hillside.\n\u201cI see it. Yes. Don\u2019t interrupt. Would the king think me prideful, for contradicting him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor instance, would the gift be forthcoming were I a lion? Or would I then be even less worthy?\u201d Tom laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd. How can I be worth less than I am now?\u201d \n\u00a0Oliver said, \u201cA lion might feel merit in his own abilities, whereas you have none.\u201d \n\u201cYes! Over some puffed up lion, the king honors me for my very lack of worth. Lions trip over inflated egos.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I see\u2026\u201d\nTom said, \u201cI have neither ability nor nobility. What a fine loser!\u201d Oliver chuckled. \u201cI am the epitome of unworthiness. I\u2019ve scaled the heights of mediocrity.\u201d\nOliver laughed. \u201cCongratulations! Worthlessness is your virtue!\u201d\n\u201cYes! Hallelujah! Make haste!\u201d\nOliver stopped. A wolf slunk across the road, toward the grazing flock. \nTom said, \u201cI see it.\u201d He jumped down and turned to Oliver. \u201cTry to keep up.\u201d At that, he dashed into the brush. \nThe wolf ran fast and Oliver fell behind. He entered a clearing and saw the wolf skulking toward a solitary lamb backed into a thicket. Silence followed its plaintive bleat. It cowered as the wolf inched forward, teeth bared. Its muscles tensed, preparing to leap. \u00a0\nThe wolf howled in pain. Spinning convulsively, it appeared to chase his tail. Oliver spotted the cat clinging to the wolf\u2019s neck, safe from its snapping jaws. Tom had pounced from a tree branch as the wolf prepared its attack. \nTom dug his claws securely. He held fast against the wolf\u2019s frothing attempts to shake him loose. Finally, whimpering, it sunk to the ground with its paws over its eyes. \nHe whispered to the wolf, \u201cYou\u2019re done here. Leave the lamb. Get packing. Now!\u201d \nThe wolf groaned in submission. Tom leaped from its back. It ran away howling. The lamb bleated. \nTom called out. \u201cTake the lamb, Oliver. We\u2019re late.\u201d\nOliver slung the lamb over his shoulder. They returned it to the flock. The shepherd ran over. Oliver set the lamb down and it bounded to him. \nThe shepherd called out, \u201cThanks guys!\u201d\nTom leaped onto Oliver\u2019s shoulder and they ran to the castle. At the gate, Tom produced the king\u2019s summons for the guard.\n\u201cWelcome! We\u2019ve been expecting you, Tom Legato.\u201d\nA lady-in-waiting escorted them to the banquet hall. Immense double doors swung open to reveal a lavishly decorated, main ballroom. Tom nudged Oliver and pointed to the buffet displaying every variety of fish. \nAs they approached, the king stood in greeting. They each bowed to him. An attendant stood by holding a pillow with a medal and ribbon for the king.\nAs the king placed the ribbon over Tom\u2019s head, he said, \u201cTom Legato, I hear-by present you with this medallion. I welcome you, an official member of the Royal Order of the Felon\u2026 I mean Feline. The Royal Order of the Feline\u2026 Sorry.\u201d\nThe sound of light laughter spread through the gathered throng. \nTom bowed his head. \u201cMajesty, call me anything you please. I\u2019m happy to be here. Thank you.\u201d\nEveryone applauded. \nThe king smiled at Oliver. \u201cI\u2019m told you rescued a royal lamb from the fangs of a vicious wolf.\u201d \nHe tried to clarify, but Tom snapped him with his tail. \nCollecting his thoughts Oliver said, \u201cYour Majesty, I do what I can. Not seeking prizes, but to explore my capabilities. What do we live for, after all, if not to make each other\u2019s life better?\u201d\nEven the king applauded that.\nThe king continued. \u201cI salute your unprecedented bravery, Oliver. At my beautiful daughter, Princess Erin\u2019s request, I offer you her hand in marriage.\u201d\nEveryone cheered.\nSpeechless, Oliver smiled at Princess Erin. She offered her hand and he kissed it.\nThe orchestra played a lively song and the betrothed danced their first dance. Everyone joined them. \nOliver and Erin soon wed. Tom Legato took and easily filled the role of the King\u2019s Official Cat. He spent happy days dispatching any vermin daring to cross the castle\u2019s threshold. \nThey all lived happily ever after."}
{"title": "Gunther, Son of Krampus", "story": "Gunther smiled at the pretty she-elf and offered her his ginger snap cookie.\u00a0\nHer clear blue eyes grew round as ping pong balls, the silver bells on her pointed red hat tinkled as she trembled, and her pouty rosebud lips quivered.\u00a0At last, she let out a scream so high pitched and supersonic, it caused a small avalanche a mile away.\nHer breath was peppermint and vanilla cake.\u00a0She swatted the cookie into the snow and ran towards her friends that had stopped their birdlike chattering to stare at Gunther in horror.\nHe looked sadly down at the broken cookie.\u00a0\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d he mumbled under his breath.\nHis silvery-grey horns felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds.\u00a0They did not, they were small, and only just starting to corkscrew, like the impressive one-and-a-half foot horns of his father, the Krampus.\u00a0His goat shaped face was dark with a soft coating of grey fur.\u00a0Someday it would be black, shaggy, bearded and warm.\u00a0Gunther\u2019s hair was only shoulder length and not thick enough to keep him warm in the below freezing atmosphere, so he wore a long wool cap, with holes for his growing horns.\u00a0He had asked his mother for a red cap, but she had made it black.\u00a0Just like all his other clothes.\u00a0The only thing he had in common with the elves were his long-pointed ears\u2026except, his were covered in black fur.\nHe sighed.\u00a0When he opened his mouth, his long red tongue uncurled to his navel.\u00a0He bent and licked the sugar-coated cookie bits like a devilish anteater.\u00a0The group of four pretty elves laughed and pointed, and soon all the elves in the playground joined in.\nThe bell rang, Gunther waited until all the elves were inside the school.\u00a0\nHe plodded through the snow on woolly black goat legs, his black hooves dragging.\u00a0\nHe was lonely.\nHe slunk into his seat in the back of the classroom.\u00a0The teacher was an elderly elf in a long red wool dress with white hair cut into a bob.\u00a0She came to him, peering over silver wire-framed pince-nez, with hands on her narrow hips, \u201cGunther!\u00a0Did you smile at Penelope?\u201d\nHe nodded.\n\u201cLook at me when I\u2019m speaking to you, young demon.\u201d\nGunther looked up.\u00a0His strange black eyes had red irises.\u00a0Miz Poppinsmith involuntarily took a step back.\u00a0She said, \u201cOh Gunther, you are truly scary to behold.\u00a0When you smile, birds fall dead from the trees of heart attacks, and black bears turn white.\u00a0Please refrain from frightening the other children.\u201d\nAfter school, Gunther walked home alone as usual.\u00a0At least Christmas vacation started the next day.\nHis mother, a good witch of exceptional beauty,\ndetected immediately the sadness in her son.\u00a0She bent to hug him, her long, honey-colored hair brushed his face, it smelled of pine and lemons.\u00a0She kissed his cheek and offered him a warm sausage popover, fresh from the oven.\u00a0\nHer pale oval face was flushed at her high cheekbones, her full red lips smiled.\u00a0The only inhuman thing about her were her eyes.\u00a0They were as big as doe eyes, but solid black as onyx.\u00a0She had given up her Nordic blue ones as a dowry to Gunther\u2019s Grandpa Mephisto.\nGunther didn\u2019t want to talk about school because there was nothing he could do about his growing frustration.\u00a0Besides, his parents loved that he was scary.\u00a0The longer his pointy white teeth grew, the broader his spine-chilling grin.\u00a0\n\u201cIs Uncle Santa coming for supper?\u201d He asked before Yursa could enquire about his abnormally long face.\u00a0Sausage popovers were Santa\u2019s favorite.\n\u201cYes, my sweet.\u00a0Uncle Santa is bringing your father the naughty list. \u201c\nSanta Klaus and Gunther\u2019s dad, the Krampus, had been childhood friends who grew up and into their stations in life, each one helping the other.\u00a0Uncle Santa rewarded good children with gifts and treats, Krampus beat the naughty with sticks.\u00a0It was only a rumor that he sent them to Hell, Grandpa Mephisto would prefer the little monsters grow up in the world to be big monsters.\u00a0\nThe rumor that his dad sometimes ate the bad children was unfortunately true.\u00a0But only the ones Yursa divined would grow to become psychotic, depraved killers or torturers of innocent, kind animals.\n\u201cHe\u2019s early.\u201d Said Gunther.\n\u201cApparently there is a sweet creature in danger at the hands of very bad children up north, between Sweden and Iceland.\u201d\n\u201cThe Vikings again?\u201d\n\u201cYes dear.\u201d\n\u201cDad will be pleased.\u201d\nGunther heard stories of the Viking children.\u00a0They were encouraged to torture and slaughter and steal from the Europeans that had worked hard for their farms and lands and belongings.\nSanta and Krampus sat by the fire, smoking after dinner pipes that smelled of sweet cloves and burnt leather.\u00a0They sipped amber cognac from cut crystal glasses.\u00a0Yursa reverently placed her crystal ball on the polished cedar table in their center.\nGunther sat at the kitchen table, pretending to read a storybook.\u00a0He peaked surreptitiously through his shaggy, black bangs, at the adults staring into the glass sphere.\u00a0Fromm where he sat, he could see whisps of swirling milkiness and the spangles of city lights or stars.\nKrampus called over to his son, \u201cGunther, you\u2019re old enough to help your old man this year.\u201d\nGunther looked up, startled. \u201cReally Dad?\u201d\u00a0He smiled broadly.\u00a0His mother beamed at him, so proud.\u00a0His furry ears perked straight up and vibrated like tuning forks.\n\u201cYes, while I am punishing the wickeds, you will have a job, an important one, for multiple reasons.\u201d\nYursa said, \u201cCome Gunther, look into the ball.\u201d\nGunther gracefully pranced over, his hooves tappity-tapped on the wood floor and thumped softly over the wool rug.\nYursa pointed into the ball and before his eyes, the celestial scene parted, the shimmering mist swirled away, and he looked upon a terrible scene.\u00a0A group of four leather clad children, in tall boots and vests and hooded jackets, screamed and waved spears in the air.\u00a0Some held dully glinting knives, and spears tipped with iron points.\u00a0Their eyes were cruel shards of pale glass.\u00a0\nThe scene widened as if the viewer were pulled upwards like a kite, hovering over the yard.\u00a0The yard was fenced with tall, cuspated logs, the ground was begrimed with a slushy mix of snow and mud as dirty as the young faces.\u00a0On closer inspection, Gunther saw spatters and pools of red in the composition.\u00a0\nIt was not the blood of the children, however.\u00a0They were not fighting each other.\u00a0They were torturing a great white bear.\u00a0Gunther looked up at his mother with tears in his red and black eyes.\nSanta sniffed, then blew his nose into his handkerchief.\n\u00a0Yursa nodded and said, \u201cBear baiting.\u00a0Cruel and inhumane.\u00a0The children are encouraged by their parents to participate in such so-called \u2018sport\u2019, they feel it readies them for war.\u00a0Gives them a taste for cruelty and blood.\u201d\nGunther said, \u201cBut they are hurting those dogs too.\u201d\nKrampus said, \u201cYes son.\u00a0They make the bear bleed.\u00a0The dogs are trained to respond to the sight and smell of blood, they encourage them to attack the bear, making wagers.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t the children get hurt? Or Killed?\u201d\nYursa said, \u201cIf they do, the adults say that it was the will of Odin, their king of gods.\u201d\nKrampus said, \u201cHmf!\u00a0They\u2019ll wish they were dead when they get a load of me.\u201d\n\u201cWhen can we go, Dad?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you there tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0Said Santa.\n***\nUnder an overcast sky, high above icy white lands they flew.\u00a0Four enormous, shaggy white and pale tan reindeer galloped through the air, leading the green and gold sleigh- silent, but for the \u2018\n of their mighty lungs.\u00a0Great white puffs from their snouts dissipated rapidly into the frigid air of their wake.\nSanta was bundled in a thick, soft woolen coat the color of dry moss.\u00a0It was lined with thick, warm beige fur that rippled in the fast wind.\u00a0His hat was matching.\u00a0Krampus wore no hat, only a black woollen cloak, his thick ebony fur undulated and whipped briskly behind him.\u00a0The eastern sky was the color of a nasty bruise. The west would soon follow.\u00a0\nGunther wore his warmest fur lined hat, pulled down tight against his head, he had belted his coat as tightly as he could but shivered as frozen drafts crept into his sleeves and under his muffler.\u00a0His eyes watered, though the sleigh featured a framed glass windshield.\nThe bleached land below was spotted with deep green patches of forests as mysterious as precious emeralds.\u00a0Great slabs of sienna-grey rock edged fast moving rivers.\u00a0On the horizon faint ashy wisps rose against the gloomy, overcast sky.\u00a0Smoke.\nAs they neared their destination, the smoke grew thicker and sootier.\u00a0The sounds of shouts and laughter and orders ululated up to them in the winds, like vampire bats.\nSanta called over the roar of the wind in their ears, \u201cDown there!\u00a0In those woods by that stream! We rest until just before dark, that\u2019s when they close the gates for the night.\u00a0The settlement is just over that rise.!\u201d\u00a0Over the hill, smoke from multiple vents and cookfires amassed and mingled with the dark grey clouds.\u00a0\nThey set up camp and let the reindeer rest, Santa gave them each a bucket of oats.\u00a0\nThe woods were dense and protected from the harsh wind, the three-sided lean-to was relatively warm after a fire was built.\u00a0They ate bread and cheese and dried herring.\nAt four o\u2019clock the sun would set.\u00a0So, at three, Gunther and his father took off at a fast pace. Krampus carried his whipping switches in a wicker basket slung over his back. Their long goat legs gracefully leapt through the snow and Gunther realized that that was what they were made for.\u00a0They made the distance in only ten minutes.\u00a0\nOutside the gate, Gunther said, \u201cHow do we get inside without being seen?\u201d\n\u201cAh my son, with this,\u201d His father pulled a shimmering black cloak from his basket. It rippled in the air like silk.\nGunther frowned.\u00a0Krampus unfolded it with a flick of his long fingered, black gloved hand, and draped it over his head and around his shoulders.\nHe was gone.\nGunther gasped.\u00a0His mother had told him about the spelled cloak when he was little.\u00a0He swelled with pride at her talents as his father enveloped them both.\u00a0They walked through the gates.\u00a0The dirty, muddy yard was devoid of life.\n\u201cSuppertime.\u201d Whispered Krampus.\nGunther nodded against his father\u2019s wool covered belly.\nThey tip-toed along the yard, staying close to the fence, stepping onto frozen mud when they could.\u00a0When they stepped in snow, hoofprints appeared like magic.\u00a0Any prints they made would only look like the prints of the Vikings\u2019 livestock.\nRaucous laughter from the communal longhouse indicated a meal in session.\u00a0Across the yard behind them, the huge wooden gates scraped closed, A thick iron bar clanged and clanked into metal brackets.\nThere were six other longhouses in the settlement, the boisterous, occupied one in the center.\nSuddenly a dog barked.\u00a0It sounded confused. The pair under the invisible cloak froze.\u00a0\nThe men who had closed the gate shouted to it.\u00a0The dog continued in a frantic manner.\u00a0Then a \u201cQuit it!\u201d in Old Norse. Then a \u2018\n\u2019 and a sharp yip.\u00a0Then quiet.\u00a0They continued surveying the yard.\nGunther nudged his father and whispered, \u201cThere.\u201d\u00a0He pointed between the next two long wooden homes.\u00a0In the yard between was the bear.\nIt looked dead.\u00a0Gunther growled low in his throat.\u00a0The bear\u2019s ears twitched.\u00a0It lifted its great head and sniffed the air, staring straight at Krampus and Gunther.\u00a0It whined sadly and lay back down but kept its eyes on the cloaked pair.\n\u201cIt sees us.\u201d\u00a0Whispered Gunther.\n\u201cBears are highly sensitive to magic.\u201d\u00a0His father whispered back.\u00a0\u201cOff you go.\u201d\u00a0He whisked the cloak off his son and Gunther went cautiously yet eagerly to the bear.\nKrampus leapt away towards the house where the children would be leaving from shortly.\u00a0He crouched in anticipation and soon heard children\u2019s voices approaching.\u00a0The youngest would be headed to bed first.\nOut the door came three little towheads, hair nearly white and tousled like baby chicken feathers.\u00a0They were very young- wobbly little toddlers, with a mother or maiden-slave in tow.\u00a0\nThese three were still innocent, they\u2019d not been in the cruel crowd of baiters.\u00a0Krampus eased back to let them pass.\nWithin seconds, another pair emerged.\u00a0Older, and with those cold grey-blue eyes he\u2019d seen in the vision.\u00a0He waited until they passed, then followed.\u00a0He whisked off the cloak, letting it drape off his back.\u00a0He followed the boys with heavy feet.\u00a0They heard and turned as one.\u00a0\nKrampus grinned.\u00a0He was a terrifying black horned silhouette, with glistening white teeth from ear to ear.\u00a0Lightning fast he clamped iron collars around their pale throats before they could scream.\u00a0The collars rendered them paralyzed. Into the basket they went.\nHe re-cloaked and waited for the others like a trap-door spider.\u00a0\nThe next two were very small girls.\u00a0They were innocent, he let them pass.\u00a0\nA taller, third girl strode out the door like a Valkyrie in training, he recognized her from the vision.\u00a0He swooped her up like a vampire and disappeared like black smoke into the night.\u00a0\nOne left.\u00a0\nKrampus waited as a wetnurse exited with a squallering wee babe in her arms.\u00a0\nThen came the boy he sought.\u00a0He was with a stocky, scruffy young man who could only be his father.\u00a0He followed.\u00a0The man stopped and turned, his eyes squinting into the shadows.\u00a0He shook his head.\u00a0\nThe insolent boy at his side said in Old Norse, \u201cThere is nothing.\u00a0You drank too much.\u201d\nThe father swatted the boy\u2019s head with a ham haunch fist and belched.\u00a0They walked on.\u00a0\nAt the closest longhouse, the father shoved the boy towards the door and said, \u201cI need to make water.\u00a0Go on in.\u201d\nThe boy went into the home, the man went to the sanitation ditch that ran behind the homes.\u00a0Krampus followed the boy.\u00a0Once inside, he removed the cloak and loomed over the boy.\u00a0The second he turned around the collar silenced him.\u00a0Into the basket he went.\nAs Krampus took the children into a barn, a lantern flared to life.\u00a0The horses nickered softly but were not alarmed.\u00a0Animals were kindred spirits.\u00a0Krampus and his kin in fact, smelled of the pleasant musky, grassy scent of buffaloes.\nOne by one Krampus whipped the bad children with his switches.\u00a0Each one he beat until the stick broke.\u00a0The children\u2019s mouths stretched into ovals in their reddened faces. Their eyes streamed; their jaws creaked.\u00a0The horses\u2019 eyes glowed red in the soft light, the four children would forever be afraid of them.\nWhen their backs and behinds were striped bloody red, Krampus said in their Norse tongue, \u201cKill each other all you like, I care not. But lay a finger in cruelty upon any animal for sport and you will pay.\u00a0Scream now, and I\u2019ll re-double the beating.\u201d He removed the collars and turned to sooty smoke, whisked out the door by a wind.\nHe found Gunther and the bear at the open gate.\u00a0Krampus looked at his son with eyebrows raised.\u00a0\nGunther said, \u201cThe bear, her name is Ingbrod, she did it.\u00a0She\u2019s very weak but is desperate to help us.\u201d\nSanta called out from the other side, \u201cOver here!\u201d\nKrampus, Gunther, and Ingbrod went to the sleigh, not bothering to close the gate.\u00a0As the reindeer flew up into the air, tiny yellow stars flickered from the sled blades.\u00a0\nThey looked down at the receding Viking settlement.\u00a0Men and women chaotically ran from the main lodge, shouting frantically, as their horses, oxen, and other livestock galloped out the open gate.\nSanta laughed, \u201cHo ho ho ho ho!\u201d\nKrampus laughed along with him.\nGunther sat in the back of the sled with his arms around Ingbrod.\u00a0She\u2019d lost a lot of blood and her oozing, open wounds were festering.\u00a0Her dirty coat was matted, and she smelled of sickness and death.\u00a0He said into her huge, soft ear, \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave us. I \n you.\u00a0You are special.\u201d\nThey flew west, under stars, above the clouds.\u00a0As they reached the Krampus home high in the Alps, clouds parted before them like shimmering heavenly gates.\u00a0Yursa ran out\nimmediately and helped her son and husband bring the bear inside while Santa took care of his reindeer.\nGunther, for the tenth time started, \u201cMom, is she---\u201d\n\u201cHush child!\u00a0We just must wait.\u00a0I do not know.\u00a0She was at death\u2019s door.\u00a0Her heart was barely thumping.\u00a0I cannot stop the reaper.\u201d\nGunther went outside and howled at the moon.\u00a0Wolves mournfully commiserated.\n***\nOn the first day of school after the Christmas holidays, Miz Poppinsmith stood in front of the class and asked them,\n\u201cHas any one seen Gunther?\u201d His desk was empty.\nThe elf children looked around guiltily.\u00a0\nPenny Weebottom said, \u201cWell\u2026 we don\u2019t really hang out with him.\u201d\nBobby Farther said, \u201cHe\u2019s kinda scary.\u201d\nMiz Poppinsmith said, \u201cClass.\u00a0I understand.\u00a0But has he not always been kind to you all?\u00a0And hasn\u2019t he tried to make friends despite his obvious scary differences?\u201d\nThe wee elves nodded.\u00a0Cheery Mayweather, who sat by the window, suddenly jumped up and pointed out of it.\u00a0She said, \u201cLook!\u201d\nAll the elves squeezed onto the windowsills.\nThere was Gunther, the strange, creepy kid in black, riding on the back of a ginormous, shaggy, glistening white polar bear!\u00a0He wore no cap, his long, shaggy black hair wafted behind him.\u00a0\nAs he approached the school, the elves ran outside.\nAs the wee elf children stared in wonder at the mountain of a bear before them, Gunther grinned.\nIt was still pretty frightening, but, shuddering, the elves grinned back."}
{"title": "The Thanks I never Gave", "story": "I lay awoken, just before the dawn of the day rises from its comfortable corners, my gaze fixed on the bedroom\u2019s ceiling for what it felt like an eternity. My name is Alexander Cornway and I have a problem. A tremendous, paramount of a problem. In just a few very short hours, I will have to get out of this bed and stare at the woman slumbering beside me. As she always does every single morning, she will yawn as loud as she can be---on purpose may I add, normally I would be asleep by that time, so she will place her corpse like hands on my back with a grin on her visage, I, as intolerant to the cold as I always have been, will bend my body in a number of ways, fighting back the shock to my system that my dear old wife loves to inflict on me. If I\u2019m brutally honest, I will paint my face with this look of annoyance and irritation, blabbering some sort of witty remark, when in reality, I simply adore the fact that she kept that childish nature instill within her, even into adulthood. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When that time comes, I will have to face the previously mentioned problem. The problem at hand being that in the ten long years after I married her, even to this very second, I still love her. And I\u2019m not talking about the---I love her as my friend, or companion that I\u2019ve lived with for such and such years and she has become a nice person to be around with---no, no, no. I still desire her! I yearn for her! I still find myself fantasizing--dreaming even about her when she\u2019s not even around. I envy my own past self, because he will get to experience the emotional rollercoaster that it was to meet her, date her, and eventually marry her. I truly love her, and I never knew how to say it. How to verbally express my own thoughts and feelings to her--- and don\u2019t get me wrong here, she knew all these things since the very beginning of our romance. She knew everything about me really, my wants, my desires, my hopes and dreams, what I hate, what I love and what I cherish. What I\u2019m trying to say is, she knows me---and I just wish I could just let her know how grateful I am to her. \u00a0\nThat\u2019s the very reason on why my eyes creep at the darkness of the room, why I can\u2019t seem to catch the sweet nectar of slumber. How lucky I am to ever have a wonderful woman like her, and where would I be if I never would\u2019ve met her? Those two questions have been revolving around my head constantly this night---every night to be honest, and although they are easy to answer, I can\u2019t hope but ponder about them. She is a deem light beaming down the darkest of caverns, she is the lighthouse that guides the ships away from sinking to the bottom of the sea. She is my light, and only second to one, she is everything in my life---apart from the brat sleeping on the room next to ours, that is\u2026 I will never love anyone as I love her, and I realize that as long as I keep her memories close to my heart, I will keep her close to me---always. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clock clicks, and time slowly flows, I now turned my gaze towards her side of the bed, my body slightly shifting to my side. I can\u2019t say that she ever slept like an angel\u2026 Her loud snores and random moans that render you awake, were more than enough to scratch that thought out of your head, yet her silver hair that comfortably rested on the whiten pillow could easily make me think otherwise. Maybe she was an angel sent from above to bless me on behalf of my creator? But If that was the case\u2026 why? Why put me in this position? Why make me lay awake at night, embracing the bedsheets covers? Her side of the bed is still warm, even though she was always cold to the touch\u2026 I guess I do know the answer to these questions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rays of the rising sun began to slither in between the gaps of the window shades. My eyes remained closed, as a sudden change of the bed became abundant enough for me to notice. I felt her hands intertwine around my chest, embracing me. I can smell the lilac lavender coming from her silver hair as it landed on the side of my cheek. I can\u2019t hope but to feel my heart as it began to race, fast as jet breaking the sound barrier, I smile as I know this won\u2019t last too long. Morning is just around the corner, and I know I\u2019m going to have to wake up soon. Yes. I realize, I have been sleeping this whole time. It\u2019s not my first time having this kind of dream, and God, I just wish it would last longer\u2026 Tears begin to be welled under my eyes, as I smile pleasantly at this whole ordeal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI love you, Eli. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you in the end. I\u2019m sorry, I never got to---\u201d\n\u201cDaddy!\u201d roared an innocent voice. A sweet melody bellowed around the room, as the wooden barrier that made the door, slammed open. \u201cDaddy! Are you awake, yet?\u201d Silver locks of hair bounce with each step, as the little girl made her way inside her parents\u2019 room. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHey, kiddo. What are you doing here so early?\u201d I groaned, adjusting myself into a seating position, I extended my arms wide to act as a landing platform for the incoming rocket of love that headed my way. The little bundle of love launched herself into her father\u2019s arms, a wide grin on her visage complemented her hazel eyes and the beauty mark on her lower left cheek. \u201cGod, every day you look more and more like your mother.\u201d I said, as a warm smile paint itself on my face, \u201cYou\u2019re growing too fast!\u201d \nShe wrapped her arms around my neck, turning them into a strong lock, I swing her from left to right in a playful manner, ultimately placing her to my side.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaddy.\u201d Rachel asks.\n\u201cyes, pumpkin?\u201d \n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho were you talking too?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cEarlier daddy, before I came in, you said were saying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d a lot.\u201d \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAh, it was nothing, kiddo. I was just dreaming.\u201d Rachel stared at her father, deep in his eyes. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho did you dream about?\u201d\n\u201cOh, just someone who, I should\u2019ve said Thank you too\u201d."}
{"title": "Cacophony, New York City, Three AM", "story": "The first time she heard the noise, it was 3:18 in the morning. She\u2019d been awake, sweating under the too-warm duvet until around three, and had just sunk into the first few moments of heavy welcome sleep, when the sound came down from the ceiling and torpedoed the early stages of her REM cycle.\u00a0\nA man\u2019s voice, shaky and thin, yet piercingly loud.\nWho the hell was Maureen? She\u2019d met their upstairs neighbor, an older woman named Barbara with a severe silver bob and a hairless cat. Barbara seemed to make a point of avoiding any friendly interactions with her neighbors. They\u2019d only spoken once, when Barbara had knocked on their door with a stack of letters and bills that had been mistakenly put in her mailbox. \nshe had remarked crossly, as if this had been some type of conspiracy against her. \nBarbara lived alone, she thought. Had she moved? No, she had seen her that afternoon, taking out her trash with a grimace on her face like taking out the trash was a personal insult. Did she have a visitor over? Who was the man yelling in the middle of the night? Who was Maureen?\nThe voice came from directly above her head, but it had a strange faraway quality, like she was hearing it underwater. The walls of their Hell\u2019s Kitchen converted two-bedroom were thin, they knew that upon moving in. They could hear footsteps in the halls and the pulsing bassline of music blasted by the college kids downstairs. But they had never heard clear voices, never been able to make out words or conversations or requests.\nThey had moved for the baby, leaving their cramped (but undeniably cool) studio in South Brooklyn for a place with \u201cmore space to breathe.\u201d Unfortunately, any space they thought they\u2019d use for breathing was immediately filled with baby toys, baby crib, baby food, baby clothes. The second bedroom was more of a glorified closet they had shoehorned into a nursery, its single window directly facing into the back of another tall brick building, offering no view and no natural lighting. The items piled up on the floor and the rooms began to close in around her. When they had announced the pregnancy, her friends with kids had told her \u201cYou\u2019ll never sleep again!,\u201d their eyes twinkling with malicious joy. Was that some kind of sick joke? They\u2019d been right. She couldn\u2019t remember sleeping through the night, truly sleeping, a single time since the baby had been born. She must have, right? Just once? She couldn\u2019t remember.\nHer husband could sleep through a bomb, and she was starting to resent him. Actually, she was starting to hate him. She would look over at him next to her in the bed, the silhouetted, snoring lump, and she\u2019d let the hatred fill up her chest until it pounded against her ribs. She\u2019d squint at him in the darkness, willing him to wake up by shooting her distilled, hardened anger at him like lasers out of her eyes. How dare he leave her to experience this alone? How dare he be able to sleep peacefully? How dare \nbe able to sleep peacefully?\u00a0\nWhen she complained to him in the morning, he\u2019d said \u201cIf you were a real New Yorker, you would have banged on the ceiling with a broom until he shut up.\u201d Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t a real New Yorker, so his advice was entirely unhelpful. She was a transplant, raised in a tiny Midwestern town founded upon steel manufacturing and \netiquette.\nHer family had worked in processing, shipping, and distributing large-scale farming equipment at the same steel plant for the last century. Her grandfather hadn\u2019t complained when a faulty conveyor belt had trapped his left hand, leaving him down a pinky and half a ring finger, \nand she would absolutely \nbe complaining about her noisy upstairs neighbors.\nAnd yet.\nComplaining made enemies, and making enemies went against her nature. Besides, who was\n to make a noise complaint? She\u2019d only just wrenched the baby out of a reverse-cycling hellscape of nightly scream-and-feed sessions. She (the baby, but by association \nhad been the primary cause of her neighbor\u2019s sleep deprivation for the past four months, she was sure of it; what right did she have to say a single word about anyone\u2019s late-night shouting?\nAnd yet.\nAnd yet, that voice. An adult voice, a man, not a baby, shouting into the sticky 3am summer air. Who the hell does he think he is?\nThe second night, the voice was accompanied by a banging so loud and so precisely placed above her head she felt it \nbe targeted at her.\u00a0\nBang! \nBang!\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to keep me up,\u201d she had told her husband after jostling him awake, having listened to the yelling and banging alone in the dark for half an hour. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to keep me up and it\u2019s creeping me out.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just someone sleep-talking,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd the banging?\u201d\n\u201cSleep-walking\n sleep-talking, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cCan you do something about it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do something about it? I didn\u2019t even hear it until you woke me up. Jesus, hon, come on. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d He rolled over to face the wall.\u00a0\n She yelled internally at the back of his head, hoping he\u2019d receive the message psychically. \nHe didn\u2019t get the message. He was already asleep.\u00a0\nBang!\u00a0\nShe spent the days walking-dead style, staggering through her list of tasks with her eyes half-shut. She just wanted to take a nap, but she couldn\u2019t nap unless the baby was also napping, and the baby wasn\u2019t supposed to nap or else he wouldn\u2019t sleep through the night. And if she was napping, she couldn\u2019t be providing the baby with \n(whatever that meant). Most days, proper enrichment meant plopping the baby in front of a TV show about British pigs so she could\n(she shouldn\u2019t be drinking coffee) \nSomehow, the baby now had boundless energy during the day. She was livid. For months, the baby had woken her up three, four, five times a night, leaving her to figure out if he was \nor \nor \nor maybe just \nNow, the baby slept peacefully through the night in his closet-turned-nursery while she lay awake in bed, listening to the man call out for\n to \n. She began to pray that the noise would wake the baby; at least then she would have an ally in her anger. \nshe could confront the neighbors, march upstairs with a screaming, red-faced infant on her hip and let them have it. She couldn\u2019t make an enemy on her own, definitely not, but she could certainly channel her rage through the bawling child.\nWithout the baby, she\u2019d be a \nWith the baby, she was justified. She was just being a \nBut the baby didn\u2019t seem to care about any of this. The baby didn\u2019t care about how much sleep she got, because the baby was sleeping happily through the night, waking up refreshed, and so was her husband, and she felt all the energy slowly leaking out of her.\u00a0\nThe next night the yelling was accompanied by another voice, a woman, quieter, restrained, but almost stern. Barbara? Barbara the angry cat lady? She couldn\u2019t make out the words, just the rhythm of the conversations, the hoarse, flustered shouts followed by the woman\u2019s voice, serious and measured.\u00a0\nshe thought. \nBang! \nShe would get no sleep that night.\u00a0\nShe would get no sleep for the next six nights. It always started right around three, the same exact way; just as she began to think \nSometimes she could make out the other voice, Barbara\u2019s voice, louder than usual, snapping at the man. \nDad. Barbara\u2019s father, frail and elderly and screaming through the night. \nshe thought. \nShe\u2019d surprised herself. She\u2019d never wished death upon someone, even in her worst moments, even inside her head. But once she\u2019d thought it, she couldn\u2019t stop.\nOn the seventh night, she lay in bed, her skin prickling with sweat from the summer heat and sweat from her rage. She hated her baby and her husband for sleeping through the night. She hated Barbara and she hated Barbara\u2019s father and she hated her bed and her apartment and its paper-thin walls and she was so, so tired.\u00a0\nBang!\nShe bolted up, throwing the duvet on top of her sleeping husband who didn\u2019t move a muscle, didn\u2019t make a sound. She got out of bed and stomped down the hall, passing the nursery where the baby (somehow, miraculously, \n) slept soundly. She didn\u2019t care if she woke him up, she didn\u2019t care if she woke the whole apartment up as she threw her front door open. Feeling the cold hallway tiles on her bare feet, the buzz of the fluorescent bulb lighting the 3am darkness, trudging up the stairs as she thought of what she\u2019d say, \nShe landed in front of the apartment, raised her arm to bang on the door because she knew it would be louder than the bell. And she heard it again.\nClearer now, as if there wasn\u2019t a door between them at all, as if he was right in front of her.\nAnd Barbara\u2019s voice, in response, softer now.\nA silence.\nShe stood outside the door listening to the silence. All silent now. There was no more shouting, there was nothing more.\u00a0\nAfter a few breathless moments, she went back downstairs, back through her door, stopping to kiss the baby on the head, to smell his warm, soft head. Her spot in the bed was gone. Her husband had rolled over in his sleep, his dense body now at the center of the mattress, arms outstretched, leaving only small cutouts of room. She\u2019d done this many nights before, curled herself inward to fit into the negative spaces beside him.\u00a0\nTonight, she pulled the duvet off her husband and wrapped it around herself. He let out a single snore, then nothing. She exited the apartment wordlessly, she didn\u2019t wake him up and she didn\u2019t leave a note. She climbed the staircase, stopping in front of Barbara\u2019s apartment, still sweet-silent, then continuing on, up, up, until she got to the door marked \u201cNo Entry,\u201d the door that should be alarmed but she knew wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d been out that door before, during the daytime, when she needed room to breathe, real room to breathe, when she needed everything to still.\nThe rooftop was empty, a flat gray slab with walls of brick just high enough that she could peek her head over the top and look out onto the buildings around her. Tonight she didn\u2019t need to look. Tonight she spread the duvet on the concrete and lay down, stretching out, taking up every corner, filling up the edges. She listened to the noises of the city below her. She listened to the rushing of late-night traffic on Tenth Avenue and the bursts of car horns, laughter, music. She listened to the rustling of leaves somewhere far away, the flaps of pigeons' wings and the whir of air conditioners set into windows. She listened to her own breath, slow, steady, deep underneath her ribs, the rushing of her blood, the pulsing of her heart.\nAnd then the heavy, ecstatic quiet of sleep."}
{"title": "Outside", "story": "I don\u2019t know how long I watched myself sleep that night.\u00a0\nMy face looked different than it did in the mirror. I can\u2019t say in what way, it just did. I wondered what I was dreaming about. Probably the usual stuff. I didn\u2019t wonder why I was floating a few feet above my own body. Not for a while at least. I can\u2019t say how long.\u00a0\nThere I was, dreaming, probably about struggling to put on a pair of socks. The socks thing is a surprisingly common motif in my dreams. I never have much trouble putting them on in the waking world. I struggle with a lot of things in the waking world, just not socks.\nWhen I did realize I wasn\u2019t in my body that night, but, instead, hovering like the ghost of a person who just hadn\u2019t died yet, my first thought was about my eyes. They were open. Not fully, but kinda squinting, like I was irritated by something very far off. I knew I did this, but hadn\u2019t ever actually seen it myself. (One time my sister recorded a video of it and showed me, but that\u2019s like a mirror, it doesn\u2019t count.)\n\u201cThe pool\u2019s closed,\u201d I said, down there in bed.\u00a0\nPool\u2019s are not a common motif in my dreams, so I felt a little left out. It was winter at the time, so I knew I didn\u2019t have a chance at going to a pool in real life. And I like pools. More than the ocean, which I can\u2019t explain.\nIt was the pool thing that made me take my current situation more seriously. If I didn\u2019t have a body, that meant no swimming, no pools, none of it. I needed to figure out how to get back into my body because I needed it. For a lot of things. But especially pools.\nI pondered what the rules might be for my current situation. How to get back into my body. Was it something that happened automatically, or did I have to do it myself, before my body-self awoke from his slumber? And if it was the latter, and I didn\u2019t, would I be trapped out here forever? Or, maybe, would I get a second chance the next night? Or, worst of all\u2026could my body even awake without its consciousness? If that\u2019s what this floating part of myself even was.\nI tried to move, but that turned out to be a bit of a challenge. Not having a body made it hard to know how to move because, for me, moving has always been directly tied to my physicality. Arms, legs, fingers, etcetera. I would have to do a little more strategizing.\u00a0\nThen I realized, even though my personal experience of moving is tied directly to my physical body\u2014by that I mean my appendages and their movement\u2014it all starts in my brain. My brain sends signals to my appendages and then my appendages do the thing my brain thought. The thing was, at the moment, I didn\u2019t have a brain. Which seemed like a problem at first, but then I realized I was having thoughts. Thoughts independent of a brain. It made sense when I thought about it (without my brain). So, if my brain was just a conduit of my thoughts\u2014i.e. if thoughts originated outside my physical brain\u2014and my movement was directed by thoughts sent to my brain, which, in turn, sent that movement-thought to my appendages, concluding in my movement, then\u2014when you think about it\u2014thought is what causes movement, not the physical brain.\nI thought about moving closer to myself and\u2014therefore\u2014did move closer to myself.\u00a0\nI didn\u2019t like being that close to my face. There was probably some deep-seated psychological issue to be dealt with regarding that response, but, at the moment, I had to deal with other issues. Mainly, figuring out how to absorb myself back into myself.\nFaintly, far off, I could hear the sounds of splashing water.\u00a0\n, I thought, completely independently of my brain.\nMaybe that was the answer. Maybe I had to synchronize my thoughts with the dream inside my sleeping brain. Sounded as good as anything else.\u00a0\nI closed my eyes.\u00a0\n(I didn\u2019t actually close my eyes, I had no eyes to close, but I did my best to focus my attention on my thoughts, instead of my current visual stimulus.)\nI listened hard to the sounds coming from my sleeping body\u2019s dream. I tried to imagine the pool, the people sloshing around in the blue, the smell of chlorine, the shape of the splashing waves.\u00a0\nI imagined I was a bat, hanging there, echolocating my own mind\u2019s unconscious thoughts. And\u2014surprising to even me\u2014it was working. I started to see things, things that I hadn\u2019t imagined, but that began to form by my resonance with the dream venting off into the metaphysical stratosphere.\nI stood on the edge of the pool.\u00a0\nI stood on the diving board.\nI stood on the diving board and on the edge of the pool.\nThe \u2018me\u2019 on the edge of the pool was the \u2018me\u2019 I had been since I fell asleep. The \u2018me\u2019 on the diving board was eleven-years-old and second-guessing his choices.\u00a0\nI had always loved pools but hated diving boards. This had always caused a tension. As a kid, if you\u2019re in a pool, you have to use the diving board or all the other kids won\u2019t let you live it down. If you tell them that you are afraid of the diving board, they will make sure to get you onto that diving board and then push you off no matter how much you struggle. It\u2019s best to just choose the diving board yourself.\u00a0\nSo this was kinda a nightmare.\nI wanted to tell myself that I didn\u2019t need to jump off the diving board, but I knew that wasn\u2019t true. Things had to run their course. A nightmare had to be a nightmare. I didn\u2019t know how dangerous it would be to interfere. I had made it here successfully, inside my own unconscious mind\u2014a feat that seemed impossible, even in the middle of a greater impossibility\u2014so probably best to not push it.\nI jumped off the diving board and made the plunge.\nI held my breath and waited for myself emerge from the water.\nI emerged from the water and swam over to the edge of the pool.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, spitting out a stream of chlorinated water. \u201cIt\u2019s better to just take the dive.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was outside,\u201d I pointed up, vaguely, \u201cand then\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get out there?\u201d\n\u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to stay here?\u201d\n\u201cStay\u2026\u201d I tried to understand what I was saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay, here. I want to go, with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhere am I going?\u201d\nI looked down at my eleven-year-old self and then came the soon-to-be-too-familar sensation\u2026"}
{"title": "For My Father", "story": "Trigger warning: Suicide, mental health\n \nSome mornings the feeling was of old lace, touch it and it falls to dust. On others she saw their little rat tails disappearing under the soffits and couldn\u2019t grab even one to yank it back and see what it was. Most days it felt more like seeing cockroaches zipping away and gone before she was even sure they were there. It had been going on a long time, this disconnection from her dreams. They just did not stay long enough in her mind to even form an image. She tried all the remedies for remembering\u2014stay still, don\u2019t open your eyes, walk backward into the scene, paper and pen under the pillow, flax and lavender eye shade, marijuana gummies, warm baths, recordings of ocean waves, sleep at odd times, mantras both poetic and mundane. But her dreams had gone AWOL. She felt stripped of a pillar of her psyche. She imagined they had all washed onto the shore of a remote Pacific atoll along with Amelia Earhart\u2019s bones.\n \nHer dreams used to be the central imagining force of her mind, the source for poems, stories and a novel told in fairy tales. Now her writing had stalled out. She started to wonder if she was losing her edge. Was this a sign of early decay of some kind?\n \nWhy would dreams be shutting down now, in the midst of a pandemic when she needed them most? They were her parallel life even before lockdown. In the past she had dreamed of conducting an animal orchestra, of flying from crumbling sand cliffs, of diving to the bottom of a green pool and even breathing under water until she realized she would soon drown. She looked at the surface so far above, a ceiling of light she could gauge right away was beyond her breath supply. She frantically clawed upward, losing momentum.\n \nFoolish how far she had dived down and lost track of time and distance. She had felt at peace tumbling in the depths of the warm pool, a water creature that wouldn\u2019t need to surface. Then so alarmed that she woke mid-stroke as if switching off a projector. She blinked into the pale light of her bedroom. Breathing fine, beyond grateful to be breathing. She had oversized lungs to begin with. She always won the contest for who could swim underwater the longest. Or in choir, she could hold a long note far past where everyone else had gasped to a stop.\n \nThis deep-green pool in the dream had almost been the death of her\u2014in the dream anyway, and maybe in life too. But close calls like this, including frequently falling off bridges, riding in driverless cars, canoeing in 30-foot Arctic waters, trying to pull her sister from an undertow, never made her want to stop dreaming. Without dreams a whole other color palette was missing. She was an imposter in life, especially as a writer. Lots of people suggested a dream specialist or a hypnotist but she wasn\u2019t sure about entrusting this part of herself to a stranger. She had a hard enough time with regular therapy. Which was useless for bringing her dreams back anyway and posed inane questions like \u201cWhy do you think this is happening?\u201d If she knew that she wouldn\u2019t have to be here.\n \nSo when she saw the table at the Farmer\u2019s Market with a handwritten sign, \u201cR\u00eave-elation,\u201d she paused. She felt a long sigh move through her body. Smaller script below read \u201cdreams used and reconditioned.\u201d The chair was empty where a proprietor might sit. Was this was a self- service operation? The dark blue cloth covering the table bore jags of yellow lightning like cartoon symbols for electricity\u2014warning that you could get a shock. It was windy but the cloth did not ruffle and the small bottles shoulder to shoulder on the table stood without teetering. All dark brown glass, closed and somber looking. Are these smelling salts, to bring on visions, she wondered, or drops to put in a hot drink before bed? \u201cUsed and reconditioned,\u201d that\u2019s some joke. What does that mean? That all dreams are basically from the same factory and they just get recycled and reused? She had always prided herself on her dreams\u2014the unique images of purple-skinned women diving in a sea cave, the museum of bombs, the overflowing shed of papers where her long-dead father still labored.\n \nThat was the one dream she longed to return to. She and her father didn\u2019t have time to begin the long task he had summoned her to. She had met him at the side of the garden\u2014his half-acre vegetable plot. It was in spring cover crop, how he had left it and wasn\u2019t returning to plant anymore. Made sense. He swung his gaze from the rye grass. \u201cYou don\u2019t look too good. You\u2019re so old. Where is my little girl?\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d she thought to herself. But she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone more than 30 years, Dad. How can you expect me not to look old? I\u2019m nearly your age now.\u201d\n \nHe said, \u201cCome here, there\u2019s a really important project you have to help me with. I want to show you.\u201d He put his baseball glove-sized hand on her shoulder where it sat nearly weightless and led her to a shed next to the garden. She could see overflowing boxes and tides of papers scattered everywhere. The work bench was completely covered, tools buried. Boxes were stacked on the rototiller, the wheelbarrow and the cart that hooked to the riding mower. On her birthdays he would give rides around the lawn in this wooden wagon until she and her brother and sister grew too big to fit. Everything was papers now, spilling over the slats. Piled invoices like layers of filo dough, cash register slips, envelopes ripped open jaggedly, file folders of brown-edged papers. Ripped, crumpled, everything mounded without organization.\u00a0\nShe could not imagine where they would begin. He said, \u201cHurry, we don\u2019t have much time, the light is fading. There is something in here, very important, that I want to show you. We have to find it.\u201d\u00a0\n \nThey stood at the shed\u2019s doorway and her hands twitched to start sorting and organizing\u2014something she was really good at. They had to find the important document or whatever it was he wanted to show her. He had never spoken to her this way so she was especially on alert and ready to help. Not like when he would command her and her siblings to pick peas or weed the garden. She could feel there was so much to learn in there.\u00a0\n \nThis shed he had never showed anyone. It seemed he had built it next to where his ashes lay in the garden, sometime during the decades since he died. He had been waiting for her to find her way there in a dream. Now they were on the threshold of a great mission together. He finally trusted her with something he had never revealed in his lifetime. Was it about his brother Robbie the priest in training who died in a mental hospital? Was it about losing the farm? Was it his own private writings done in rehab? She had heard hints of these stories from her aunts but that\u2019s as far as it went. Whatever her father wanted to tell her, she was sure she would know him a little more. She longed to know him not just as the severe man who committed suicide right after Thanksgiving. He had saved all these important papers to show her. She welled up with gratitude. With so little time, how would they start?\u00a0\n \nJust as she and her father were entering the shed she woke up. She could feel the huge revelation hanging, invisible, waiting to be brought to light among the papers. Then nothing. Gray windows at 6:42 am. She was furious.\u00a0\n \nMaybe it was from this time onward that her dreams seemed to abandon her more and more.\u00a0\u00a0But if she had to choose, this was the only dream she cared to revisit. Wouldn\u2019t she and her father have gone into the shed and started to work on the piles side by side, reminiscing, sharing familiar oddities they came across--who is this in the photo, remember your green moleskin shirt? The big revelation was not within reach anymore, now that her dreams had de-coupled from her psyche and gone on a different track. These tracks had no distant point of convergence\u2014they traveled resolutely parallel. She leaned from her window and strained to see if her father was on the other train. It faded into its own smoke.\n \nHow could used and reconditioned dreams be of any help to her? She wanted to return to a very specific one, not end up with someone else\u2019s worn-out weird dream they had discarded. And what could be reconditioned? She had circled the whole farmer\u2019s market barely seeing the late summer tomatoes and sweet pea bouquets with sunflowers. She had been staring inward at the papers in in the shed. When she arrived back at the\u00a0R\u00eave-elation table a blocky man was seated in the folding chair, squinting from under his crocodile hat. She imagined through his black denim shirt to the tangle of tattoos over his whole body. His arms fit tightly in the shirtsleeves and she could picture a cottonmouth twining over his biceps. He adjusted his hat and twirled his cigarette out on the sole of a white boot with real fur patches left on the leather. For a man of amphibious skin he had a lot of knuckle hair.\n \n\u201cFar away on the giving and getting.\u201d\n \nShe wasn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s what he said but it seemed addressed at her.\u00a0\n \n\u201cKin I help yeh?\u201d\u00a0\n \nShe expected to smell booze as she stepped closer. The farmer\u2019s market was usually so wholesome\u2014who was this?\u00a0\n \n\u201cWhat de yeh fancy, pretty lady?\u201d he offered again. \u201cPromenade in green? Keys to the kingdom? High, low, rocky road?\u201d He paused.\u00a0\n \nShe stopped moving.\n \n\u201cI see it. You want to go. He awaits, green light on behind. Take the train, the slow train.\u201d\n \nShe looked into his greeny mud-brown eyes and felt him see straight into her grief. Still, after 30 years. And now, especially after the unfinished dream and all the others lost. She longed to walk next to her father again. They wouldn\u2019t have to shuffle papers. They wouldn\u2019t even have to talk.\n \n\u201cThe one about the shed, that\u2019s the dream I can\u2019t give up. All the others you can have. Enough to fill the Library of Alexandria. Maybe the trade is good. What do I fancy? Just one more afternoon with my father. I need to ask him about the shed, why he showed me all that stuff and then just left.\u201d She spilled the words and then felt like fleeing.\n \nThe man\u2019s fingertips paced over the shiny black caps of his brown bottle army. His fingernails were a nauseous shade of yellow. With a click of his tongue he picked up a bottle, opened and sniffed and quickly recapped it. \u201cToo acidic. Wipes your memory. Some want that.\u201d He went back to fumbling over the neat rows of bottles. This one he held up to the light. \u201cNot enough culturing time, still cloudy.\u201d He closed his eyes and let his hand drift like a metal-detector. She wanted to pull away and get back to normal errands, but she had waited this long. His stubby fingertips closed on the neck of a bottle in the center of the collection. He lifted it slowly, dangling it down in a way she could only call unsettling.\u00a0\n \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said Pokeweed for you\u2014didn\u2019t take you for a chancer. But here. Don\u2019t drink it, just put it under your pillow.\u201d\n \nShe couldn\u2019t move.\n \nHe murmured on in a thin voice: \u201cHow many dream fires I have doused with this wicked tincture and yet some may still live in a useful form. Take special care, this is the hazmat dump of the whole collection. Once I give it to you I\u2019ll start right in on the next one. I\u2019ve got the base liquor all ready in the still\u2014 maybe you saw my trailer in the parking lot, with the pipe on the side? These days I can pass for one of those teardrop camper types, just a little more rough and tumble. Been at it for some time, back to the Pleistocene you could say.\u201d\n \nYou don\u2019t say, she thought. What drugs did he grow up on?\n \nHe was still dangling the narrow bottle over the table between them. It had a murky orange glow that reminded her of eucalyptus honey. The more he moved it, swinging like a bell, the more it seemed to pick up moisture from the air until it was covered with a haze of condensation. Then it started to smoke like a lump of dry ice. \u201cIt\u2019s all charged up, m\u2019lady.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n \nWithout thinking she reached out and let him drop the bottle into her left palm. She closed her fingers on the slender smoking glass. A sting ran through her body.\u00a0\n \nOK, she thought, this guy has something going here. I should probably run.\n \nHe was watching her with interested wavering underwater eyes. They were the color of the deep pool where she had swum and nearly run out of breath, come to notice. He smiled with a few teeth, black gums.\u00a0\n \n\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d\n \n\u201cKeep it in the sun when it\u2019s not under your pillow. Don\u2019t let anyone else touch it. Bring it back when it runs down for a free recharge.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow will I find you?\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you will,\u201d he said, sliding his chevron eyebrows up and down.\u00a0\n \nShe started to feel seasick, the earth was sliding away. What if this was a bottle of jinx? Why was she still standing here? She looked around at the deserted farmer\u2019s market. They were alone next to a garden and the light began to fall.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u201cHow do I know I you aren\u2019t trying to mess me up with this stuff?\u201d\u00a0\n \n\u201cI thought that\u2019s why you stopped by, dearie. The daytime world is just a little too dry for the likes of you. I traffic in the underneath. You know it, you crave it. You\u2019ve grown out of the usual portals. I wouldn\u2019t give you Pokeweed if you weren\u2019t ready.\u201d\n \nMore nonsense palaver, but her hand hadn\u2019t fallen off, and the electrical current had backed off to a mild massaging purr. Her eyes felt loose in their sockets. She gave in, why not at least pretend she would try it.\u00a0\n \n\u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d she managed to mumble.\u00a0\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll collect, you\u2019ll see,\u201d he winked.\n \nShe didn\u2019t remember sleeping but now she was in a little shed on wheels. It was her own bedroom crammed into a trailer. Images sloshed through her. She had been in a white city in the dawn, the mist of the river still low to the streets. She had wandered a souk. There were bright fabrics decorating the passages and more for sale in stacks everywhere. She reached under her pillow. A cool ghost of a shape slipped from her grasp. She felt around but nothing stayed.\u00a0\n \nShe could smell a bit of river mud and duckweed. She dove down under the covers and looked back at the souk where she had bought beignets and a blue and gold fountain pen. The pen gave her left hand a little electrical shiver when she felt it in her vest pocket. Through an arched door she caught sight of four white hooves and golden fur patches bounding onto a wide lawn. She thought she saw her father next to the garden, on a low yellow stool like a mushroom. He was peeling back cornhusk on brilliant silver ears that he stacked into a tower. The empty shed stood open."}
{"title": "Hidden Secrets", "story": "Javier walked across his large yard as usual, taking his Australian shepherd Zooloo out for her morning run. It was still early, the sun was just beginning to rise through soft hazy shades of pinks in the sky, frosted puffs of cotton breath in the air, promising a crisp day ahead.  Zooloo ran ahead of him, through the piles of leaves on the far side, near the maple and apple tree's, now darkened with the onset of winter; leaves fallen to the ground, branches bare and cold. Except for the wind rustling, silence permeated his surroundings. The frigid air moved through him, like a thousand tiny inch worms crawling into his bones. (He only wore a light jacket and jeans), not exactly ideal attire for a morning like this. Thin layers of crusted snow blanketed the fields. Time stood as still as the rocks, a simple life on this farm, Javier's thought's were on other things, like travelling.  \nJavier shivered, pulling his jacket tighter around him for warmth, wishing he'd worn a more suitable coat, 'winter is coming',  he mused unhappily, wishing he could go South like he often did, but he had to stay here and take care of their farm, belonging once to his grandparents, handed down to his parents. This is where he was raised and grew up, but he dreamed otherwise. His bedroom boasted a large world globe ball, the kind you turn around and around, Javier would, every night before bed, mark the spots with tiny different colored stickers. Midwest winters were harsh, however, summer's were spent growing and harvesting enough food for the winter. Their animals needed enought to eat and stay warm, chickens and two cow's they kept. Several barn cats, and sweet Zooloo, she acted like it was all hers, she was the life of the party. Javier watched her, as she began to sniff, digging around fervously around one of the maple's, picking on one spot in particular. Paws frantic, leaves pushed up and around, while her breath smoked out in huffs into the cold air.\n****\n\"Ok, girl, take it easy, what have u got? A dead squirrel....you...can't...eat that.\" He fondly scolded his dog, pulling at her halter, away from the spot she'd been digging, not wanting to see what she'd found if a dead animal lay beneath the dull leaves. Zavier's stomach growled, hunger crawling in him now, breakfast would be ready soon, his mother always on time. Routine had become redundant, but time flew by as they had plenty of chores to do.  \n\"What the heck?  Hmph, how did this get here?\" He said to noone. \n****\n, waiting to be picked up, taken home. Javier stared, his face scrunching to look more at what he thought he'd found, he then picked it up. A diamond ring, a large one at that, surrounded by smaller perfect little stones, dirtied of course, and looking old. He wiped off the dirt with the cuff of his sweater, Zooloo already lost interest and was running around him in circle's now.\n'What the heck!\" His mind raced, \"Who does this belong to and why is it here, on our land, lyin' neath a pile of dead leaves, and how did Zoo know to find it?' These were all the questions running through his mind. Think. This ring is worth a fortune, definately enough to pay him a trip South, Florida or Cuba, wouldnt that be somethin' else. All his life he wanted to take that special trip, feel the warmth of sunshine, sit under palm tree's on a sandy white beach, just never happened, he was not going to leave his parents alone for now anyway, and he had to finish college. Once his Agriculture Degree was under his belt, diploma at hand, he might take a trip then, some of the local kids from town could help his parents out next winter for a month anyway, he could go somewhere.\n\"I have to tell someone, where would I explain gettin' enough cash to go on a trip, this ring must've belonged to someone.\",  he wiped back the sweat on his forehead, in spite of the temperature he was warm now, pulling shaggy hair back behind his ears, with strong weathered fingers, aged from work and the change of seasons for his age. He put the ring deep into the pocket of his jeans. Now he felt a sprig of anticipation seap into his veins at the find, wondering what it meant. \n? This ring signified something, on their land. \n. He already knew who was going to tell it, he thought, knawing hunger continually winning him over.\n\"Com'n Zoo, let's go home for breakfast, bacon and eggs girl?\" He called to his dog, who had already began to sniff out other spots and did her business. Tail wagging happily at the word \"breakfast\", she followed her master home, back to the warmth of the fireplace hearth and food. The kitchen already was full of the scent of coffee and bacon, he inhaled deeply as he stepped in from the cold. The large oak table was inviting, the fireplace warming the living room, food cooking on the gas range. The wood stove held the coffee pot, old cast iron having cooked a million meals in its time, already steaming with fresh made liquid. Javier bounded in through the door, leaving the empty field behind him as he entered the kitchen, slowing his pace down respectfully.\n*****\n\"Go wash up breakfast is ready.\" His mother said, tiredly. She rose early, began the cooking for the morning, made coffee, set the table, same old routine, then chores. She was in her fifties, signs of grey hair at the sides, once having been blond and beautiful hair, while her eyes portruded the laugh lines of living. Three generations here on this farm, she was a proud woman, the land was theirs. But nothing came without its price, and their land held its own secrets, she knew and kept to herself, no sense in dredging up what had been. \n\"Ma, I found something, or rather Zoo found it, in the leaves, stuck underneath one leaf.\", Zavier pulled out the diamond, shoving a mouthful of scrambled eggs in at the same time, placing it on the table. \"Who's ring was it? It was on our property, near the big maple tree across the yard.\", He added, precariously, feeling it belonged to him.\n\"Let me see, oh dear, it was your grandmother's ring, I remember, you found it.\" Her voice flat, poured coffee into her husband's mug, he sat silent, rarely speaking most of the time, Trent was non-sociable person. But a good kind man. His body etched up to get a glimpse of the ring, his strong shoulders tightened in anticipation of this discovery. He knew what happened, of course he knew, but they never talked about it. Not after the funeral, she was small then, a little girl. But something changed, as his wife took a deep breath, so intense that he could feel it from deep inside her.\n\"Why would it be under a leaf?\" Zavier persisted, spreading strawberry jam on his buttered toast hungrily, now he was curious. It would appear a story was in the works here, and he was anxious to hear it. His mother rarely spoke of his grandparents, he often wondered why whenever he'd asked about them.\n\"It's a long sad story, you may as well know now that you found their ring. It began a long time ago, after we were born here, in this house. Your grandfather was kind enough at first, but then, after the kids were born he began to drink, and it got worse.\", She began, trying to remember that night, when the world changed for her grandmother and her aunts and uncle's, who witnessed the tragedy, left with the evils of alcohol and anger, and their struggle's to survive.\nWhat are you talking about? I ain't never been to that place in my life.\" Gramps was pompous, overbearing as he'd shouted at his wife, a strong built woman herself, she stood up against him. Anette worked hard to keep the farm and her kids clothed and fed. Gabriel was already drunk, and in one of his moods, basted with alcohol, he hated himself enough lately, but he hated her nagging even more than himself. He'd loved his wife once, long before the kids were born, 8 children altogether, one having died, the last one.......then the cloud took over him. He tried to stop but couldn't.\n\"I heard you was down at her shack, with that hillbilly whore, Eilleen told me at the bazaar, saw you two kissin' through the open window. At least you could've shut the blinds.\"\n\"I won't have my husband flaunting around, not with me or our children in this house, you hear me old man?\" Voice firm, her lips tight with angered emotion.\nShe'd sounded more on the attack to him, his breath stenched heavily with the smell of booze, his face unshaven, his eyes darkened with the devil. He'd lashed back at out at her, threw her up against the wall, shouting. His large body overbearing on her small frame, Annette couldnt fight against him, fear stung through her like lightining bolts. For the first time in their marriage she began to back away from him steps unsure of their footing, the kids could hear everything from their rooms, and now they had come out and stood above the railing, watching with wide eyes, waiting for the moment to settle down.\n\"I ain't done nothin', quit your haggling me over nothin' that happened at all. Those damn nosy busy bodies outta mind their own business\", He shoved her aside, and went out on the porch, lighting a cigarette and inhaling deeply. It was a hot muggy night for this time of the year, the air thick with humidity. Eilleen shuffled out after him, hoping to calm him down.\n\"I dont want to fight, come back inside and eat your dinner.\" She'd begged him, trying to take his arm and bring him inside. Aggravaton and anger took over after that. He yanked her hand away, aggressively. Eilleen teetered back, stumbling, on the top of the staircase facing the yard, she fell backwards. She hit her head, died the same night of concussion. The doctor was called and then the priest, leaving her husband with the aftermath of pain, and feeling responsible. In a truthful manner of speaking he was, even though it was a horrible accident, he had never meant to murder his wife. Gramps was never the same after that, inevitably so, he sunk into a deep depression, he couldn't face that horrible incident.\n\"Finally, two years later, he died they said, of guilt and shame. It was also said her ghost walked this house before he died, he would say she came to pay him back for his wrong doings, for sure none of it was probably the truth, who knew?\" Javier's mother continued, fingers cradling her coffee mug. Outside the sun had risen, now shining through the kitchen window, glittering on her hair while she spoke, her voice deepened from sadness? \"His two sister's who came to live there and take care of him, and the kids had even heard strange noises, late into the hours of the night, but nothing was ever substantiated. Haunted house stories were not uncommon in farm country, this one was no exception to tall tales\", and now, the story was a demise, the words out like tar, poured onto the ground and tasting like a bitter black piece of gum.\n****\n'And so, Gramps of course was never the same, after the funeral he must have tossed the ring away on the ground, left there after all these years until now.\" His mother finished the sad story. Zavier said nothing, feeling only the remnants of grief for his gramp and gram, the kids left behind with no father. Times were hard then, but they got harder, especially for those poor kids. Her face held back the anguish she never mentioned; she then continued to sit down and eat her own breakfast.\nSomeday, he would go South, but not now, this ring was an heirloom piece, his mother would of course keep it, as she well deserved to keep it, the ring belonged to her. He got up, put a warm coat on, whistled to his dog, and went to the barn to do the morning chores. The tale of the tragedy that befell his family years before, the ghosts that lingered here, engulfed his heart heavy with memories of what he'd found that frosty morning under a leaf.\nTHE END\n****************"}
{"title": "I never wanted to speak in public", "story": "(CW - mentions of racism and privilege, as the character comes to terms with an uncomfortable truth about their life)\n \nI know when I\u2019m tired by the feeling in my bones, and my eyes. It feels like my whole body is chafed, irritated and aching all at the same time. I know I need to sleep. It's 3.18 am and I know I will be exhausted tomorrow. But I also know that I need to know everything that everyone is saying about me. Why, you ask?\u00a0\n \nBecause it is important to know how people see me after what happened last weekend. I need to know how their opinions have changed after what I said. Stretching my toes, I know that I should leave it there. Let the trolls stay up all night pondering why I said what I said and what rock I will crawl out of next. But I know that I won\u2019t, I can\u2019t. I am like a cat who has found the scent of a mouse. I need to know what will be said next.\u00a0\n \nI didn\u2019t mean to be racist. I really didn\u2019t. Well, at least I think I didn\u2019t. Maybe that\u2019s the point? Trying not to be racist rather than just not being racist. It's almost like when your mom tells you to be nice, so you act nicely but would you have been nice without her prompt? Probably not.\u00a0\n \nI still think that \u2018racist\u2019 is a strong word for the views I have. Views I thought anyone would have had if they came from where I come from. No wait, not views. Opinions. I can be swayed. I am have an open mind, I am open and invite discussion and debates. I can't think of a time right now, but I certainly wouldn't turn down an opportunity! look at the work I have done saving the rainforest. that involved a lot of difficult conversations.\n \n....am I actually openminded?\u00a0\n \nI now no longer need to scroll, I simply refresh my feed and there's another one. I hold my breath as I open the comments, the meme itself could be mildly entertaining if its subject wasn\u2019t my humiliation. Still, I suppose it is the most accurate to what actually happened.\u00a0\n \nI never wanted to speak in public, I was asked - no requested. As the second oldest woman in our family still working, I was told it was a great honour to represent the women of my family. So, like everything I try to do, I wanted to make our family proud, to make myself proud and to inspire the younger women in our troop. I also wanted to give a nod to our ancestors. The women and men who took on this land and made us the family we are. Wealthy. Intelligent. Independent. I am grateful to them.\u00a0\u00a0\n \nHow was I to know that I was being live streamed onto Facebook? Would it have made a difference to what I said? No, probably not but at least I would have had a say in the matter.\u00a0\nThat is the real problem of this age. Consent.\u00a0\n \nWe must ask for it for everything, yet when it matters, we don\u2019t. People don\u2019t care about the impact their actions have on a person, as long as they have asked for consent first.\u00a0\nBut I did not consent to this.\n \nWho would have thought my own family would have asked me to leave OUR family reunion after my speech?\u00a0\n \nYes, it is true that I do not have children and it is also true that I do not have any friends from different countries or creeds. Indeed, I live a sheltered life on this island. But, I still deserve some respect. Especially from those who came after me. After all, they all still profit from our hard work on the ranch.\u00a0\n \nMy god, someone has said I should burn in hell! The views of the clip have reached nearly 500,000, and that\u2019s without including the shares and their views. Am I really that bad of a person that I should no longer exist? A tingle runs through my fingers and my eyes feel as though I am looking through a vortex tunnel. I NEED TO GET UP. I hate anxiety attacks. I know that it will not go away on its own.\u00a0\n \nSo I give up on sleeping. After all, what is the point in trying? Maybe I should put my version of the truth out there? My truth. Tell them my side. The public has only seen one side of the story.\u00a0\nI am not a horrible person, I wanted to tell the story of our family to remind us of where we came from and how proud we should be of our heritage and family values. I am not a slave trader and I can\u2019t help that my family were. I should not be held accountable for their actions, and if so, why has no one else been accosted like I have?\u00a0\nSomeone has commented on my privilege. What does that even mean? Well, despite my family\u2019s wealth, I am not rich - not in the monetary sense. I shop at the local market, I don\u2019t wear expensive shoes or clothes. I rarely go on vacations. What makes me privileged? What is white privilege?\u00a0\n \nAfter a quick google, I watched a video explaining white privilege and I am shocked. But it still isn\u2019t my experience. I haven\u2019t taken a role destined for a person of colour. In fact, I never went to college or have a job, aside from our family ranching business.\u00a0\n \nSure, healthcare has never been hard for me to find, Dr Benson has always been available- she is such a dear! Admittedly, I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to not have her. Where can you find a good Dr, or Dentist? Ok. If the definition of my privilege is this, then I have no choice but to slightly concur. That is correct, I have privilege- but doesn\u2019t everyone?\u00a0\n \nThe door creaks a little as I open it slowly, trying to be quiet. The sound of crashing waves in the distance brings me back to reality. After a few deep and intentional breaths, I remind myself of how much I have always loved it here. The combination of the salty fresh air and the sound of the waves crashing on the shore are the only sleeping tonic I have ever needed. Yet, how would my life be different without it?\u00a0Ok, maybe in that respect, I also have some privilege. But that isn't down solely to my race, anyone could have found themselves in this position. If I was black and in this position, would I still have this privilege?\u00a0\n \nI feel uncomfortable in thinking that in some ways I have had a head start in life. Something I had not chosen for myself, but that was provided to me because of when and where I was born and the people I have grown up around. My whole sense of self has been defined by the history of my family, and yet when I dig deep and think about what had to happen for this to be so, I can feel my body tensing. It feels as if my tonic has turned rancid. A bitter taste in my mouth has developed and I need to get rid of it.\u00a0\n \nMy mother always said that a good night's sleep solves all of life's problems. Perhaps she\u2019s right, but I suspect in this respect, she is wrong.\u00a0\n \nTurning off my phone, I crawl back into my soft and ever inviting bed. My sanctuary. I pull the cover over my body and look up at the blank ceiling thinking of those without this luxury. The homeless, the poor, the deprived. The weight of this thought makes me sink further into my mattress. I feel the weight of this realisation and feel ashamed that these thoughts had not crossed my mind before. maybe that is also the point? Sometimes we need a reality check to truly know who we are and where we\u2019re heading in life. I have a feeling that this may have been mine. I know now that I need to change and I don\u2019t know how, yet. But maybe I can start with an apology?\u00a0\n \nYes, tomorrow I will start there.\u00a0\n \nGood night.\n "}
{"title": "Morning", "story": "This morning, I wake up and find a pregnant woman in bed beside me. In my bed. There's no mistaking the swelling of her belly.\n \nThis woman, she's a young thing. From the side, she appears too young to be so pregnant, maybe 16 or 17 at the most.\n \nShe\u2014the young woman\u2014has long brown hair. Long. It flows everywhere, on her side, onto my side. And it has soft curls. Really pretty, I wish I had hair like that.\n \nI lean up on my elbow to see her face. You'd do the same, right? Maybe I shouldn't have.\n \nShe has my husband's face. No shit!\n \nI've lived with him long enough to know the turned-up corners of his eyes, the sun browned freckles from our days on the beach, the subtle curve of his jaw, the gentle ridge of his nose, even the way his cheekbones form arches. There's no mistake\u2014it's my husband's face.\n \nAnd yet... yet it's not his face. It's softer, smoother. It's lost the hardness of masculinity. I swear, those lips are fuller and form a cupid's bow that wasn't there yesterday. Sun flecked or not, she's definitely not my husband. I'm confused.\n \nShe hears me stirring and opens her eyes. \"Hey,\" she says in a husky voice. \"G'morning.\"\n \nOhmygawd, she has my husband's voice. You think after 12 years of marriage I wouldn't recognize my own husband's voice? It's softer, melodic, but that's the way he greets me every morning: \"Hey. G'morning.\"\n \n\"Who are you?\" I demand. \"What the hell are you doing in my bed?\"\n \n\"Huh?\"\n \n\"Where's my husband? Where's Conrad? How the hell did you get into my house?\"\n \nShe turns her head so her face\u2014his soft face\u2014is full-on to me. \"Honey, I'm Conrad. I'm just...\" She pats her pregnant belly and winces. \"Isn't this neat? We're gonna have a baby.\"\n \n\"Not in...\" Crap. How can I say this? Not in my bed? Not in my house? Not in my lifetime? But I don't feel that way. She seems like a nice little girl. How can I yell at her? Could you?\n \nAnd\u2014and\u2014and we tried really hard to conceive a child. For the last 13 years, since we got married, nothing worked. They say I'm fertile. They say Conrad's fertile. They say there's no reason we couldn't. I'm 33 years old and I finally gave up.\n \n\"Not in...?\" she wonders, as a distracted look flits across that familiar face. \"... in this house? Honey? Don't you recognize me? Does the belly confuse you?\"\n \nWell, yeah. Yeah, it does. It really does. How can someone go to bed male and wake up pregnant? \"This is crazy. Where's my husband...?\"\n \nShe frowns. \"I'm your husband. Really...\" She stares down at herself. \"No, I guess I'm not anymore.\" She makes a ball with her fist, presses it against her uterus.\n \n\"That's right. I can tell looking at you that you're not. How did you get in? Where did you come from?\"\n \nShe stretches and the blanket slips off. She's naked, naked all the way to her toes. This pregnant woman with my husband's face and voice\u2014from the look of her breasts, she's almost ready to nurse. She sees where I'm staring and cups her hands around them. \"Neat, huh?\" she says.\n \n\"Yeah. Neat,\" I answer grumpily. \"Just peachy.\"\n \nThen there's that look again, that pained look, as if to say come on woman, get with the program here. \"What am I supposed to do? You were asleep and I didn't want to wake you up. This just kind of... happened.\"\n \nI'm not seeing this\u2014it isn't true. Please God, pleads my head, when I open my eyes, please make her not be here.\n \nBut my eyes still see a pregnant woman. She swings her legs over the side of the bed. Something stops her momentarily, a guarded wary hesitation.\n \n\"I gotta pee,\" she says, going into our connected bathroom. She waddles when she walks, like a... a... damn it, a pregnant woman.\n \nIn a feminine way, that's how he stands. That's how he walks, holds his head. Except for the awkward pregnant arch of her back\u2014she could be Conrad's younger sister.\n \nStill, there's no mistake. Those are Conrad's eyes. That's how he always looks at me, with a sort of sentimental tilt, a subconscious twinkle. She loves me. Damn.\n \n\"Look,\" I hear myself say as she sits on the toilet facing me. \"Look, girly. I don't know how...\" Crap, why am I angry? She's done nothing to incur that, except be here. Here, now, when I least expected her.\n \nShe finishes in the bathroom, wiping herself with a big wad of tissue. There are tears in her eyes, shining in the glare of the bathroom fixture. Her tits start to shudder from little sobs and a drip pauses at the tip of her nose. She dabs at it with more tissue.\n \n\"I... I don't know how to... to convince you that I'm me,\" she says. \"I didn't do this on purpose. It just happened.\"\n \n\"Shit, you expect me to believe that?\"\n \n\"Please? Please see with your heart, not your eyes.\"\n \nOuch. That's such a Conrad thing to say. I married him because he seemed to understand me, understand how I felt, even when I didn't understand myself. \"You can't be him,\" I tell her. \"You're soft, feminine.\"\n \n\"And... pregnant. Is that it? Is that what's...\" There's that hurt look again, fleeting across her face. \"I'm cold.\"\n \nI'm starting to feel sorry for this bloated slip of a girl\u2014the way she cradles her belly in her hands, the way she sways, bracing her back against the baby's weight. She's trembling.\n \n\"Wear my robe. It's too long but it will do until I can find you something that fits. We'll go to the mall this afternoon and buy you some maternity clothes that are presentable.\"\n \n\"I guess that means you won't throw me out?\"\n \nOh hell. Okay, so I can't throw her out. It's clear she has nowhere to go. She gives me as much of a hug as her belly will allow when I put the robe around her.\n \n\"Thank you,\" she whispers. Except that it's \"thang k'you\" in his\u2014Conrad's\u2014light accent, and she doesn't even know she says it that way. His way. I still wonder\u2014am I going insane?\n \nIt can't be possible, you know. What would cause a 35-year-old man, a husky outdoorsy man, to transform into a pregnant girl? From her appearance, she's lost half of Conrad's age. And she accepts it so nonchalantly. Shouldn't she, shouldn't he, be freaking out to wake up like this?\n \nThis young girl, she waddles gingerly after me as I go to the kitchen. She's having a tough time; she's panting, sharp breathes she doesn't want me to hear.\n \nBefore I can offer her anything, she gets Conrad's favorite cup out of the dishwasher. Sweet man that he is, he washed the dishes last night after I went to bed. She couldn't have known it was there.\n \nCould she? Well... could she? She pours coffee just the way he does. She catches me looking at her and smiles. Yeah, it's his face alright, that's his smile.\n \nShe shakes her head to get the hair out of her eyes and sips the hot brew. It must be too hot because she winces again.\n \nHow would I treat this if I saw it on the nightly news? \"My husband was a pregnant girl when I woke up this morning. He wasn't pregnant at bedtime last night. And he's never been a girl before.\" Yeah, right.\n \nShe seems awfully nervous now. She keeps flicking those... those dreamy blue eyes. His eyes were always so beautiful, so hypnotic. I think that's what I fell in love with when I first met him. What am I thinking? Am I just imagining that she's him. How would you handle this?\n \nHer coffee cup is on the counter now, as though she's afraid she'll drop it. I frown. \"Are you okay?\"\n \n\"No,\" she says. Her voice cracks. It's thin, reedy, and worried. \"I just pee'd all over myself. I... I'm sorry about the mess. I'll clean it up.\"\n \nI look down. She's right, the kitchen floor is wet. But it's not pee. My gawd, her water just broke. She's going into labor. \"How long has this been happening,\" I ask. \"How far apart are the contractions?\"\n \n\"Contractions?\" she wonders as I seat her gently into a chair. Doesn't she know?\n \n\"The sharp pains. In your belly. How long?\"\n \n\"All night,\" she says. \"I didn't want to wake you up.\" She... she didn't want to wake me up... she's a hell of a lot braver than I'd be.\n \nNow it makes sense, the quizzical looks, the odd way she's been holding her belly, the fleeting glimpses of pain. She has no idea what labor is. And I've been too stupid to recognize it.\n \nBut every woman knows about labor. We talk endlessly about having babies, about the pain, about how to handle it. My mother told me about childbirth. Prepared me for my role in the natural rhythm. Even though I can't seem to conceive, it's part of growing up female.\n \nThis girl... look at her. The pain is making her miserable, and she doesn't understand. She shuffles her feet aimlessly.\n \nThis is no joke. She really is pregnant. Whoever the father was... I wonder if there was one or this is some kind of... of... oh, hell, I don't know. Anyway, he's not here\u2014and the only help she has is me.\n \nI squint at her. Yes, she's in agony. Her belly clenches and unclenches. So do her fists, hidden between her legs where she thinks I can't see them. The coffee maker whispers in the background as I watch the clock on the stove. One minute. One and a half. Two minutes apart.\n \nThat means she's nearly ready. I sprint for the phone and call 9-1-1. \"My...\" I look at her sitting so stiffly, so stoically and almost say the unthinkable\u2014my husband\u2014but catch myself. \"My daughter is in labor,\" I lie. \"Her contractions are about two minutes apart.\"\n \n\"We'll send a unit right away, ma'am. What's your address...?\"\n \nIt's so close, too close. She's down on her back screaming when the medics get here, giving in at last to the pain ripping through her. And it seems only moments before I hear the baby's first cry.\n \nThe paramedics are gone. They've given her a sedative, not enough to knock her out but just enough to put her at ease from the leftover pain.\n \nThe look in her eyes as they laid the baby girl on her chest, that look says it all. Look what we did, they plead to me. Look, a little girl. Don't send us away now. Please?\n \nI can see the top of its little pink head, with little wisps of hair, as it nurses on her tit. \"She's beautiful,\" I say, sitting on the edge of the sofa looking down at them.\n \nShe looks up at me and smiles. \"Thang k'you, Gretchen,\" she says.\n \nHmmm. In the time between waking and now, in the madness of giving birth, I don't remember telling anyone my name. The dispatcher only asked for the address. And I know the girl didn't ask, not in the bedroom, not over the coffee cup. And then she couldn't, once we both figured out the reason she was suffering.\n \nI sigh. \"Not a problem, Connie,\" I hear myself say.\n \nIf she's not Conrad, if she's a stranger... well, she still needs a roof over her head for a while. Until the baby is older. I don't know her name, so Connie will have to suffice.\n \nAnd if she really is Conrad, it's a lousy name for the new baby's mother. Connie\u2014that's a lot nicer, more feminine, a good name for a young woman who's just birthed a daughter.\n \nThe baby is finished nursing now, asleep in the crook of Connie's arm. With her free hand, Connie pulls the robe over her breast, hiding the nipple. Looking fondly at them, I think... no matter what happened, she could be my daughter. I guess that means I'm a grandmother now. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be, maybe it's all for a reason.\n \nBut I'm still confused. What would you do? What would you do if a stranger, a pregnant woman, was lying beside you when you woke up? A stranger with your husband's face?\n "}
{"title": "Broken House Rules", "story": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everything was ready for the ritual. The thing about it was that Leaf Cole could not recall how he became a part of it, at least not yet. His only assignment was to go down and take pictures of this small town in Massachusetts for a possible movie. He rented a place from the Slices when he arrived. The Slices included Bryan & Lucy the parents and John the oldest son and two daughters who where away.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room he rented in the Slices home was nice. It wasn\u2019t empty but it did have some decent things in it. The Slices themselves seemed like normal people but boy he was to find out how wrong he was. He had missed all the possible signs even before he started his trip. The supposed movie he was to take pictures for was a ghost story. He didn\u2019t think anything about it at the beginning, but he wishes now he had. What was there to ask questions about? It was a movie; he was taking pictures and that was it. He wasn\u2019t in the movie Leaf thought. That was hint number one, he thought to himself as his eyes tried to bring into focus what his mind simply could not comprehend. The room wasn\u2019t pitch black nor was it bright as day. That distinction led him to think, exactly how long had he been in that room? He truly did not know if it was night or day. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second clue Leaf missed was the houses in the Slices neighborhood. There were three stories houses that were almost identical. They were colors he had never seen on houses before. This too he gave no thought because he was from New York, there are colors everywhere.\u00a0He went over in his head the many things he ignored that perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have. The family themselves seemed fine but what he did recall was the constant warning about the \u201cHouse Rules\u201d. But there wasn\u2019t any House Rules, as in more than one, there was only one. Bryan, Lucy, and John made it their business to make sure he was told to read them. The night he arrived after dinner Leaf made it his business to do just that. There was only one house rule, \u201cnever open the attic door.\"  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaf tried to remember how he got in this room, was this the attic? Why, what was in the attic he had wondered. Leaf for many days had shaken off the curiosity to look. It kept getting the best of him because of the repeated admonishment to read the house rules. Leaf took in a deep breath as memories of how he got in the room flooded back. It was weird to him, but he found himself more disappointed than scared. He recalled late one night when he thought everyone was gone. He turned the knob of the attic door. As he ascended the stairs he was hit on the back of his head. Today, he awakens and doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s been out. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaf was tied down on what felt to him to be some type of gurney. He was tied hands and feet, but not his torso or lower limbs nor his head. With the hint of light that did enter the room he could see what looked like coffins. He started to scream and thrash about, yelling for the Slices. He soon heard steps coming up the stairs. He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes it was Saw Sawn, his boss from New York. Leaf asked, \u2018What is this Mr. Sawn, what are you doing here?\u201d Sam walked across the room and turned on the light switch just over Leaf head. Leaf looked at him and there was nothing he noticed about the man that would have made him question anything. There wasn\u2019t today nor had there ever been. But why would he be here as a part of what looked like something crazy. He was just Mr. Sawn. He was a suit and tie kind of guy. His shoes always polished to shine. His hair always neatly laid. Leaf thought maybe that\u2019s what it was, Sawn was always suit and tie dressed, no matter the occasion. \u00a0Whether it was dinner, lunch, brunch, or supper he was going to be dressed. No one thought it strange especially not Leaf because he recalled his father was a little like Sawn. So, Leaf paid it no mind, he wishes he had of now. Leaf noticed that even after Sawn turned on the light switch only one solid light came on. Leaf raised up just enough to see two coffins, now clearer. \u00a0\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Leaf yells in Sawn\u2019s direction. \u201cLeaf you are a part of an experiment my son.\u201d \u201cThere is no movie.\u201d \u201cThe ad in the paper, I put it there.\u201d \u201cI knew you would choose mines. Sawn replied. Mr. Sawn already knew Leaf was going to pick his ad. He had been dropping hints about the whole thing, into Leaf\u2019s subconscious weeks before. The boy never picked up on it, even after Sawn begin talking to him about it. Leaf was such an easy target, Sawn would say. \u201cSo, I\u2019m here what do you want with me, what experiment?\u201d Leaf angrily asked.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat have you done with the Slices he yelled?\u201d \u201cWell, my boy they are fine. They\u2019re apart of this too.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t find them odd or better yet this neighborhood nor this house?\u201d \u201cNo of course you didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d Sawm asked. Leaf continued attempts to untie himself even while Sawn was still in the room begin to aggravate Sawn. \u201cPlease stop, you must keep up your strength.\u201d He would often tell Leaf this of which Leaf would reply, \u201cstrength for what?\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t the trying to get away as much as it was his constants asking of questions that drove Sawn crazy. \u201cWhat is this for\u201d What is that for?\u201d \u201cWhere is Bryan, Lucy and John?\u201d \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you gagged?\u201d Sawn would turn and asked Leaf. Sawn had warned the Slices that Leaf needed to be gagged because he would be screaming. The Slices had assured Sam they would be back before he awoke. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so they were about an hour or so after Sam arrival here comes the Slices, the parents and John.\nLeaf however recalled that Bryan had told him they had three kids, a boy and two girls. The girls were away, at least that was what Leaf was told. He had only met John, where were the two girls? \u00a0Leaf with shock in his eyes turned his head to the right looked over at the two coffins. There standing by each coffin was a member of the Slice family. All Leaf heard before he passed out due to shock was, everything is ready for the ritual.\u00a0"}
{"title": "Styx and Stones", "story": "A cold thick fog enveloped the muddy banks of the River Styx, chilling Persephone\u2019s ankles. Demeter pulled Persephone\u2019s coarsely woven robes tightly around her\u2014robes of finely combed linen made from flax soaked in olive oil. When dried in the balmy Grecian sun, Persephone\u2019s clothing smelled of newborn lambs and gentle sunbeams and fresh mown grass, but her dark destination had none of those sensations\u2014nothing to smell, nothing to taste, nothing to feel.\u00a0\nDemeter kissed her daughter\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cI do not want to go back,\u201d Persephone cried out. Demeter gathered her only child into her arms, drawing her close. In the warmth of the embrace, both of the goddesses could feel the other\u2019s broken heart still beating. Persephone looked up in time to see her mother\u2019s grief stricken face, jaw clenched and eyes ablaze.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d Persephone asked.\u00a0\n\u201cNo, my love,\u201d her mother replied, steeling herself, making her heart a stone. It would resolve nothing to weep in front of her child. \u201cI am angry with six pomegranate seeds and the duplicity of the gods.\u201d\nEven as they walked stoically out of the realm of men, Persephone noticed how Demeter blasted the land behind them with an Aeolian wind. Trees shook off their colorful autumnal leaves. Vines dropped their fruit. The fair land and its lavish bounty rotted and decayed as the two passed. Trailing their footfalls, the verdant greens of the landscape withered into ugly browns, sending a shudder down the spines of superstitious men. Death seemed nearer, as the darkness encroached earlier and earlier, shortening their days.\u00a0\nThe goddesses proceeded out of the mortal world hand in hand, Persephone\u2019s small white hand clasped in her mother\u2019s large callused one. Browned by the sun, Demeter loved working in the fall fields\u2014loved the harvest\u2014loved reaping grain with her sharp scythe, standing next to the illiterate laborers, all rejoicing in the earth\u2019s richness. But as the time drew nearer for Persephone to return to the Underworld, her mother grew quieter, more withdrawn.\u00a0\nShe seldom left their rustic abode late in the season, preferring to sit by the fire and hull barley by hand, dehusking the grains with mortar and pestle, grinding them into a fine flour. Old widows around the Aegean Sea found linen bags full of barley meal placed under their straw-filled pillows as they slept, necessary foodstuffs to keep them alive throughout the winter.\nWhen Persephone arrived safely home to her in the spring, Demeter would breathe life back into Gaia, warming the soil, fertilizing the womb, reanimating the natural world. Until then, Demeter would sit by the River Styx and wait, brooding and counting the times Helios drove his chariot from east to west.\u00a0\nPersephone attempted to keep her lips from quivering, swallowing hard, blinking back hot tears. But the coldness of the riverbank\u2019s fog startled her, reminding her of all the bleak months she would have to be at Hades' side, the souls of the dead swirling and bewailing their fates around them. It was enough to drive her to madness.\u00a0\nPersephone wept again freely. Her mother stood nearby, rubbing her back like a small child until Persephone\u2019s sobs subsided. Her mother did not cry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAre you thirsty?\u201d Demeter asked.\nHer daughter nodded.\nFrom her girdle, Demeter unstrapped a small wineskin, full of barley-water flavored with mint. \u201cDrink while you can, my dearest.\u201d\u00a0\nPersephone quaffed her fill while her mother kept watch, their sandals unsettlingly sinking in the mire. Standing by the River Styx, Demeter watched the murky water roil in whirlpools as far as the eye could see.\u00a0\nFinally, she spotted Charon, the ferryman, still a good ways off. Demeter bitterly wished his infernal boat would capsize and drown him for good, but the old haggard fool remained relentless in his approach. Even from a distance, Demeter could see him adroitly wield his ferryman\u2019s pole. She needed to say her goodbyes, as Charon was fastidious about his transporting the dead with exactness and alacrity. There would be no quarter given to mothers who wanted a bit more time with their children, even though it was wholly unnatural for children to leave their mothers behind while descending to the Underworld.\u00a0\nCharon was coming, and even the gods were afraid of his bad-tempered outbursts.\nWhen Persephone returned the wineskin to her mother, Demeter pressed a small silver coin into her hands, a \n, to pay for her trip into the realm of the dead.\n\u201cFor the ferryman,\u201d Demeter reminded her. \u201cDo not look Charon in the eye. He knows where to take you in the dark. Do not be afraid. He knows to whom you belong.\u201d\nAt the mention of Hades, Persephone's eyes closed in despair. Demeter held her again, her daughter silently weeping along the moldy river bank.\u00a0\n\u201cWill you think of me?\u201d her daughter pleaded, watching Charon maneuver his craft to the shore, displacing the fog.\u00a0\n\u201cI do not ever stop thinking of you,\u201d Demeter replied, offering her daughter a tender smile, the same smile that appeared over her cradle not so many years before.\n\u201cIt is so long until spring\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow could I ever forget you, Persephone? You grew in my womb just under my heart. You are my only child and my beloved, dutiful daughter. I have the days numbered until you return to me.\u201d\n\u201c\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \u03bf\u03b3\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf,\u201d her daughter said.\n\u201cYes, one hundred and eighty two days . . .\u201d Demeter repeated.\u00a0\nCharon motioned and grunted for her to embark, holding out his hand and scowling. Persephone placed the \nin his hand, which quickly disappeared into his robes.\u00a0\n\u201c\u03a3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ce,\u201d Persephone whispered, a foot on the boat, turning for one long look at her mother\u2019s weathered face.\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d her mother replied, sending her daughter off to a cold hell with a warm smile.\u00a0\nPersephone crouched in the hull, looking for her mother on the banks of the River Styx until out of eyesight.\u00a0\n\u201cI will be here until you return,\u201d Demeter called out into the night.\u00a0\nThrough the gloom she could just make out the whiteness of her daughter\u2019s hand, waving a farewell\u2014the sight of which dissolved the stone in Demeter's heart, turning it into a river of tears."}
{"title": "The Curse of Blackwater", "story": " \nAges ago, when petty kings fought for dominance over the land, lawlessness and cruelty were sovereign. Chaos was most rampant in the neglected countryside, far removed from the trappings of civilization. The Lords, busy with their squabbles, cared naught for the common folk. They waged war as long as there were boys to be taken and armed for their hosts.\n \nOne such Lord, a knight no less, was a man of bravery but also fierce temperament. His victories in war made him rich both from its spoils, as well as from his liege's favor - none other than the king. After a great victory against another claimant, Sir Bernard was rewarded with his very own fort in the outmost fringes of the realm. With it came the title of Lord of the remote village it towered over - Blackwater. This gave the knight plenty of opportunities to launch unsanctioned raids and wreak havoc on the settlements beyond the King's border.\n \nBattle had made the knight a callous commander and, after endless seasons of bloodletting and war atrocities, Sir Bernard was more beast than man. Too many years he had spent on the back of his war horse. No company but that of his merciless henchmen; sleeping rough, ever clutching a blade. With plunder and murder as his daily bread, he no longer knew any law but that of the sword - his sword.\u00a0\nWith time, Sir Bernard's reputation as a savage warlord grew. Invitations for feasts became sparser and sparser, until they stopped altogether. The once-celebrated champion of the king was now thought to be no more than a glorified cutthroat. Company with whom not even the most modest of the gentry would want to be associated.\nAt first, the knight was downhearted to be made an outcast. Bitter and assailed by self-pity, he soon found refuge in drinking. Whenever he would drown himself in liquor, violence soon followed and his fits of anger often resulted in a frenzy of cruelty inflicted on his own people. It wasn't long until everyone learned to avoid the fort as much as possible. Even his servants dared not risk his attention for long, lest they became the target of his malice. Thus did the peasants of Blackwater took to calling their Lord, Bernard Black-heart.\nBernard's heart might had been rotting, but his mind was as sharp as his blade. With age, his martial prowess declined. He knew that if he could not carry on with his raiding parties, the silver would dry up. There was only one option - he needed to marry into wealth.\n \nIt was an unwonted apparition witnessed by that fateful Sunday's mass. One met with surprise and a wave of whispers of hushed-tone gossip. Everyone knew better than to interrupt service, for the priest was a zealot and bitter man keen on inflicting punishment on the less pious. But even he found himself unable to utter a single word from his half-gaped mouth, when Sir Bernard walked through the church's door, accompanied by armed men.\nEver since the Lord had taken residence in the fort, the priest recalled only but a handful of events wherein his church had hosted such company. Even then, only in the distant times when the king still honored Blackwater with a royal visit.\nThe black knight strode down the nave's aisle to the front of the altar, where the most preeminent freemen attended mass. There, he greeted them and signaled the priest to continue before giving the shocked congregants a chance to bow.\u00a0\nAt the end of mass, the custom was for villagers to linger and exchange niceties as well as gossip. But that day, all eyes were on the knight, who waited not for his intentions to become clear.\u00a0\n \nHe approached the elderly patriarch of a rich merchant family and, with a solemn tone, announced his wish to marry the man's only daughter - Lillian was her name.\nThe old man was speechless and looked over at the scared girl who cowered behind the tall figures of her brothers. Their faces betrayed the revulsion to the idea of marrying their sister to a man of such infamy. Knowing their place all too well, they bit their tongues.\u00a0\nThe father invited their Lord to discuss the matter further in the privacy of their townhouse. It was no secret Sir Bernard's coffers were running low and that her dowry was the solution for the knight's problems.\u00a0\n \nHis reaction, however, they did not expect.\u00a0\n \nOffended, he wondered aloud what a high-born would do in the abode of ones such as themselves. The church echoed with murmurs and the old man felt the people's gaze like a humiliating pierce. The proposal stood, as Sir Bernard put it, most beneficial: The merchant's daughter would be elevated to nobility, as well as any children she would bear him. With a child on the way, the king, who worried over the continuity of that borderland's defense, had promised to make him a Baron. An opportunity to bring the mercantile family into the circles of high-nobility came less than once in a lifetime.\u00a0\nThey hesitated, as the mumbles of the eavesdropping townsfolk ceased and turned into looks of envy.\u00a0\nAnd thus, reluctantly, they agreed to the proposal and shook hands with the Lord, as tears gathered at the corners of the girl's eyes. Her frightened stare met only with the most devious of grins, as Sir Bernard Blackheart bowed before departing.\n \nBut they had all been tricked. For Sir Bernard's lies and machinations were deep as his lust for riches. In truth, a royal missive had arrived threatening to depose him of his fief. The king feared indeed for its defense but aimed to grant it to a younger, stronger Lord who could keep taking the fight to the enemy. A decision the Blackheart Knight was confident he could overrule with the birth of an heir, and a decent amount of silver.\n \nWhen the girl's protective brothers heard of this, they were livid and came at once to the fort of Blackwater. There, they mustered their courage and confronted the knight with these rumors. Emboldened by their own audacity, they questioned the Lord's ability to provide comfort for their sister.\u00a0\nThe servants and guards all held their breath for the poor brothers. They above all were accustomed to their master's temper and cruelty, even towards those who groveled beneath him.\u00a0\nTo their shock, Sir Bernard replied calm and collected, as to what evidence had they of this claim. The punishment for such unfounded accusations was severe and it ended especially bad when coming from those of lower birth. He questioned them if they had considered the rumor's veracity before spreading slander.\u00a0\nTaken aback, the brothers swore on their lives they had not uttered a single word to a living soul. They had found it more honorable to come with the news straight to the Knight himself and grant him a chance to defend his honor. Not even their father knew they had come to the fort.\nSir Blackheart grinned once again, as he did that day in the church. Not only were the rumors true, but also spread of his own volition. He had counted on the brother's hasty confrontation. With their whereabouts unaccounted for, he had them murdered right there and then.\nHonor, he thought, always shoved young men at sharpened steel.\u00a0\nWith one command of his voice, the knight became the sole inheritor of the merchant's wealth, as soon as he married Lillian.\u00a0\n \nTheir father, however, suspected what had happened. Without proof, he could not avenge the murder of his sons, but he could still call off the wedding.\u00a0\nThis too, Sir Blackheart had anticipated. His men were sent out to capture Lillian and bring her back to his fort. Once there, he raped her before her captors could even leave.\nWhen her father noticed her missing, he feared the worst and roused some village folk to storm the fort. Most dared not raise arms against such an unforgiving Lord, but the promise of wealth was enough encouragement for a small mob to muster.\u00a0\nBlackheart had for the third time been expecting this. At the fort's threshold, he stood with but a few warriors and the town priest. Still bloodied, Lillian stood not far behind.\n \nThe Blackheart Knight, once again calm, inquired what business had the old merchant with an armed host at his doorstep.\u00a0\nThe father demanded his daughter back. At such old age, his ability to fight was questionable, but his eyes burned with wild bloodlust.\nSir Blackheart put on his darkest grin yet. He asked the priest whether he had not been a witness to the betrothal that had taken place in his very own church, before God Himself. The priest nodded, his gaze heavy to the ground.\nIt dawned on the old merchant what the knight had plotted from the very beginning - It was no accident the request had taken place during mass. What he could not have foreseen was when Sir Blackheart lowered his head and confessed to kidnap and rape.\u00a0\nBewilderment overcame the mob as Sir Bernard Blackheart asked for forgiveness from the girl's father. His confession to the priest, the knight added, not being enough to uplift his soul.\u00a0\nMet only with ominous silence, Sir Blackheart continued his petition. The waiting had been too much for him to bear. Fearing the spread of ill rumors to be a plot to break the engagement, he acted.\u00a0\nHowever, a compromise could still be reached. He was willing to give Lillian back if her father admitted to the plot and paid for damages to his reputation. Or he would marry her in that instant, preserving her honor and even forgoing her dowry.\nThe old man dropped his weapon and knelt to the ground sobbing. It was over. He could never take his little girl home.\u00a0\nAdmitting to plot against a noble would surely ruin him. His family's name would be dragged in the mud and he would never do business again. A life of begging in the streets awaited him, without any means to provide for Lillian. This assuming his own life would even be spared.\u00a0\nThere was no one to appeal to either - The priest and witnesses most likely siding with the Knight for fear of retribution. If only he could still give his little girl's hand in marriage to another man, then maybe she could still have a second chance at life. But with her purity defiled, no one would ever take her as a wife.\nWith a last cry, he looked her in the eyes and reached for his knife. As he pushed it into his feeble heart, he prayed to God the Blackheart Knight would die soon after.\u00a0\n \nLillian was inconsolable. One moment she was frolicking in her youth and wealth, another, her entire family had been taken from her. All she had left was a life sentenced to serve the man who had destroyed or defiled everything she held dear. She pleaded with the priest, a holy man, to what kind of God would allow for this to happen. God, she was told, was infinite in His wisdom. And as a woman, she was sinful by nature. To repent, she was told to do.\n \nLife was no longer worth living for Lillian, but the thought of revenge kept her going forward. Every morning and every night she would pray for God to execute divine justice and smite down her husband.\nBut she would not just wait and let fate take its course. With her wealth and newfound status, she had a convent built for His worship. Also, a place where women who had lost everything could dedicate their lives to God - a fate she wished for herself before her age had awoken the lust of cruel men.\u00a0\nBut even there, she was confronted with the priest who had been an accomplice to her husband's crimes. Undermining her efforts and belittling her cause, he put forth every obstacle imaginable against women joining the convent. Ever since its founding, none but a handful of souls had entered its service.\u00a0\nLillian's life was torture and a constant reminder that God was deaf to her suffering, as were all His subjects.\n \nOne day, her heart sank as she came to learn her biggest fear had came true - She was with child.\u00a0\nThe thought of bearing the spawn of that sadistic man made her sick to her soul. It was then she decided to take drastic measures and for the first time in her life, a woman's life, be the one in control.\u00a0\nIf God was not willing to listen to her pleas, there was another who was willing and able - the Devil.\u00a0\n \nShe knew what had to be done. Renouncing God was the easy part. He had never brought her solace. Hell couldn't possible hold any surprises for her.\nPledging herself to the Lord of Darkness was a harrowing experience, but the reward would be the power to undo her enemies.\nIn the end, there was but one last price she needed to pay for binding her soul in fiery damnation - the blood of the innocent. Not only innocent but high-born too, she thought to sweeten the deal.\n \nWithout hesitation, she took the knife her father had used to end his own life and plunged it into her womb. Blood was everywhere and her vision started to fade, but she could not help but smile.\n \nFor most, this would be the end. But not for Lady Lillian of Blackwater - The Devil had accepted her pact.\n \nShe woke up from her dreamless slumber on a bed in her namesake convent. Surrounded by the poor souls who tirelessly maintained it despite the lack of novices. They told her, she had been asleep for weeks on end. In that time a lot had happened.\u00a0\nUpon finding out his unborn child would never live, Sir Blackheart had flown into the biggest rage yet. He had burned the entire village to the ground and holed up in his fort when he heard the King had sent a Baron, to claim the fief as his own. The siege lasted but a few days and the Baron had stormed the tower and killed her husband.\u00a0\nSir Bernard of Blackwater, the Blackheart Knight was dead. Lillian could not contain the tears of joy. The Devil was true to his word, it seemed.\u00a0\n \nBut that was not all. The Baron, having other fiefs to manage, had departed and abandoned the fort in ruins.\u00a0\nThere was no more Blackwater, only ashes. Lillian's home, burnt to the ground, would never be rebuilt without a Lord in the now derelict fort.\u00a0\nHer freedom, she thought, would have nay a price too high.\n \nLillian recovered fast and soon took on the robes of Abbess at the remote and lonely convent of Blackwater. But her vendetta was far from over, and she had no intention of betraying her Dark Lord to whom she had pledged her soul.\nThere was one more man she sought to bring down - the priest.\u00a0\n \nLillian's dreams were filled with dark omens and terrible insights. She had learned the whereabouts of said priest, but also that her sisters had all been defiled by him in the past. All\u00a0locked away in that remote convent so that one man could relieve himself of any urges of the flesh without consequence.\nShe summoned them all and laid her vision of vengeance. A vision where women were not a commodity, a vision where they would not suffer because they had been born women. A vision where what made them women was not sin, but a gift to be wielded. Not by whatever morals a deaf God dictated, but by their own whims and principles.\n \nThat night, all five sisters made a solemn oath. Not to the Devil, but to each other, with the Dark Lord as witness. They asked for power and the price remained the same. That night, five babies went missing in the black of the night, snatched from their cribs. Their high-born blood, the ink to seal dark vows.\u00a0\n \nThat terrible and darkest of nights, the convent and its most unholy order were reborn as the Coven of Blackwater. Its mission would be forever to elevate women from the yoke of God-fearing men.\u00a0\n \nBaptized with the blood of an anointed priest, she now proudly stood as Lilith, the witch of Blackwater, first of her kind, and the head of the Coven.\n \nAnd since that day, every year on All Hallows' Eve they uphold their vows: To feast on the blood of little princes and barons alike. To feast on them for as long as women need to be witches, just so that they may belong to none but themselves.\n "}
{"title": "Degrees of Sound", "story": "There is no such thing as silence, only degrees of sound.\n \nWhen one imagines sound, or noise, they imagine loud things. Cities, concerts, car crashes. Sudden or prolonged high degrees of sound.\n \nWhen one imagines silence, they may picture many things. Empty woods, a nighttime street, a cemetery.\n \nWhen Ben made the decision to take a vacation in a small isolated house on the seaside in Maine, he had certainly imagined silence.\nInstead, there was just a different degree of noise.\n \nThe world outside did not stay silent in the absence of humans. Instead, it raised its own volumes. A legion of crickets chirped away in the summer night, wind from a storm still days away twisted and moved the trees into an uneven orchestra of wood, strange animals made either mating or death calls deeper into the forest behind the house, while the ocean crashed and roared upon the rocks a few dozen feet in front of and below the house.\n \nThe house itself was no better. It did not stay silent. Its wooden construction moaned and creaked with each strong gust of wind, and when there was no wind, the wood instead settled into place.\nWhat the noise wasn\u2019t was the sound of humanity. No cars or their horns, no shouting or crying. This was as close as Ben could get to the world without Humanity, and to him that was close enough to silence to satisfy.\n \nHe let the relative silence wash over him as he sat back in the reclining chair in his temporary living room. It was one of three points of interest in the small space along with an old and small couch, and an ancient television that created a field of static whenever it was turned on. He ignored the television, focusing instead on a dry book about gardening he had brought with him on the trip. The book tended to make him relax and grow sleepy, which was a good complimentary effect to the lack of Human sound.\n \nThe books effect was powerful when combined with the sounds outside, and before he knew it, Ben was putting the book down and falling asleep right in the reclining chair. Drifting off to the sounds of the endless sound of waves on rock.\n \nThen, he was shot awake by a high degree of sound.\n \nHis eyes blasted open, recognizing it as the sound of the old wooden door slamming shut, as it tended to do when it was windy. He made to move, but found his body locked in place. He couldn\u2019t move much beyond his eyes.\n \nAnd he wasn\u2019t alone.\n \nIn the living room, staring at the television, was a Human. Only it wasn\u2019t. It shared a general human shape, or close to it, but instead of flesh and blood seemed to be made up of sea mist and a collection of wet tree leaves. The concoction swirled around itself in a human-like shape, and the human-like head seemed to be tilted towards the television.\n \nIf he was able, Ben would\u2019ve shrieked.\n \nDespite his lack of noise, the figure stopped looking at the television, and looked to him instead.\n \nIt didn\u2019t speak, it had no mouth after all. Instead, Ben\u2019s vision seemed to cloud as an ocean wind barreled into his mind. Inside his head, he could hear reverberations that resembled those of the ocean falling upon the rocks outside. But they were more formed, they had more of a shape than the tranquil chaos of the rocks beyond. But the shape didn\u2019t coalesce for him.\n \nOnce again, the figure barreled him with the noise, and finally the shape of the noise came into focus. They were words, distant and hard to fixate on, but they were there.\n \n\u201cYou are loud.\u201d The words informed.\n \nBen blinked; his brain overwhelmed from what was happening. In seeming response, the figure moved over to a nearby window, and without words or much movement seemed to blast it open, the wooden hinges giving way as the wood framed sides of the window slammed into the walls beside it. Once again, the figure blasted him with its words.\n \n\u201cYou are loud.\u201d It said once more.\n \nBen\u2019s confusion shaped into coherence somewhat. He tried to form words, but his mouth would not cooperate. How could he be loud when this\u2026thing was slamming windows and doors?\n \nThe figure pushed its form of words into him once again, seemingly in response to his own thoughts.\n \n\u201cYour breathing, the creaking of your dead tree shelter, the small radioactive square in your pocket, the ceaseless sighing. It is loud.\u201d The thing chastised.\n \nBen wasn\u2019t sure how to respond, was it reading his thoughts?\n \n\u201cDo not question. It is an observation. You are loud.\u201d The thing slammed into him once again.\n \nBut Ben was here for silence, not noise, quite the opposite. He wanted to get away from the noise of other people.\n \n\"You bring your breath, you bring your loud explosive metal creation of rubber and steel, you bring the ceaseless radiation of your small black touching square stones. You are loud.\u201d It said in correction.\n \nBen didn\u2019t know how to react, except that he was sorry?\n \n\u201cYou always come. You bring your noise and your waste. Silence is preferable.\u201d It intoned into him.\n \nBut nature itself was noise, the animals and the ocean were noise. This THING was noise.\n \n\u201cThis is meant to be. Your noise is not.\u201d It said. If it had emotions underneath the cracking and crashing of its \u201cvoice\u201d Ben couldn\u2019t read them.\n \nBen thought he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to do about that, his existence was noise then.\n \n\u201cYes, you are loud.\u201d The thing confirmed. Ben thought on anyway.\n \nIf his existence was noise, what could he do about it?\n \n\u201cConsider more. All of you could do so.\u201d It said to him.\n \nBen was equal parts terrified and confused at this point.\n \n\u201cConsider more. Your blocks of radiation. The black sludge of dead creatures that leaks from your explosive metal construct. The sound of your ceaseless sighing. Silence is desired, you are here. Consider it.\u201d The voice had taken something resembling a patronizing tone, as much as crashing rocks and water could have such a tone, it was the closest to an emotion the thing had managed to have thus far.\n \nBen was mostly just back to terrified now.\n \n\u201cConsider.\u201d It commanded. And Ben mentally agreed.\n \nBen\u2019s eyes blasted open.\n \nIt was daytime now. He could hear the silence of the ocean crashing, though more distant now with the tide being out. The trees continued to creak and crack with the wind, though the tone was different.\n \nHe shot out of the chair, taking deep panicked breaths. As he looked around though, there was no sign of the\u2026whatever it was.\n \nCalmness began to find him as he looked around, confirming the lack of signs of intrusion. Though questions against his sanity remained.\n \nAs he circled the living room, listening to the sound of his breathing and panting, he noticed the window. It had been blown open, seemingly by wind.\n \nAt the base of the wall, under the window, Ben noticed a shimmer. He knelt and put his hand on the floor. His hand met hardwood floor, mixed with a faint wetness and a damp tree leaves.\n \nHe stood up, his heart pounding more than it had been. It probably blew open while he was asleep, and the leaves just mixed with sea air.\n \nIt was a solid explanation.\n \nHe still decided to turn off his phone for the rest of his visit."}
{"title": "Breaking All the Rules", "story": "\u201cToday\u2019s the day I change,\u201d Leaf thought as he laid on the gurney. His entire life for that matter would be changing. He also knew in that moment it would be changing for the bad and not the good. He had to come up with a plan to get out of that attic and away from the Slices. He wanted to survive whatever they had planned for him. He had no one to blame but himself. He read the one house rule and he broke it. He chose this path, but who knew. He wanted to know from Sawn, why him and where are the Slices two daughters.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At another round of questioning from Leaf, Sawn finally relented and allowed Mr. Slices to answer the question concerning their two daughters. \u201cMr. Slices would you be so kind to indulge Mr. Cole?\u201d Sawn asked.\nMr. Slices walked closer to Leaf to allow him to hear clearly. He looked down, directly into Leaf\u2019s face. \u201cMr. Cole my daughters, Rebecca and Rita are not gone off to school as in the traditional sense.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d Leaf protested. \u201cMr. Leaf\u201d, Sawn interrupted Mr. Slices before he could continue, \u201cthat is the kind of talk and or behavior we will not tolerate.\u201d \u201cIf you want an answer to your question, we, no I must insist that you reframe from such language as it disrupts the ambience.\n\u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d Mr. Slices acknowledging Sawn\u2019s curtailing of Leaf\u2019s outburst. \u201cYou\u2019re most welcome Bryan.\u201d \u201cYou see the two caskets Mr. Leaf?\u201d Bryan continues, as he lifts himself from Leaf\u2019s face and walked back and forth down the length of the gurney. \u201cTherein lies my two daughters, Rita and Rebecca.\u201d Leaf automatically assumed the worse, but he didn\u2019t ask how nor why. He had no other choice but to assume Bryan had killed them. What else could it be? Here he was, tied up on a gurney smack dab in the middle of what looks like a ritual. Well, hell\u2019s bells Leaf thought, a ritual of sorts is exactly what it looked like because that\u2019s exactly what it was. Bryan turns to Sam, \u201cdear brother would you like to continue. \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cLeaf my boy Bryan and I are brothers. I know we look nothing alike, but it is what it is. We\u2019re brothers from different mothers., as the kids say.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same last name because we have our mothers\u2019 last name.\u201d Leaf could hold it no longer, \u201cwhat in johnny apple seed does that have to do with why I\u2019m here on this gurney and why there are two dead girls in caskets?\u201d. Mr. Slices found himself tickled at the johnny apple seed thing and laughed out loud. He looked over at Sawn, who didn\u2019t find it amusing at all. Leaf, saw the disconnect between the two brothers and explained, \u201cOh I wanted to use more favorable words, but I remember what happened last time.\u201d \u201cI want someone to tell me what\u2019s going on without my having to be taken down memory lane.\u201d Leaf exclaimed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaf could not believe Sam and Bryan were brothers. He never would have put the two together, they looked nothing alike at all. Sam was a tall man, dressed well while Bryan on the other hand looked like a version of Al Bundy, just shorter. Both brothers were clean shaven. They didn\u2019t sound alike at all. They didn\u2019t walk alike. This contrast made Leaf wonder so many things, one what in the world did their father and mothers look like. Leaf quickly changed his mind on that question and decided he really did not want to know. It would serve no purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bryan continued, \u201cRita & Rebecca were both born with a rare disease, that\u2019s all you need to know about that except,\u201d he stopped. \u201cExcept what Mr. Slices?\u201d Leaf asked. \u201cIt killed them both at different stages of the disease and at different ages. Rebecca is the oldest and she dies at 15. Rita was 14 when she died.\u201d Leaf anxiously asked, \u201cWas there no cure at all?\u201d \u201cIf there was a cure they would be here, now, wouldn\u2019t there?\u201d A soft voice climbed up the stairs into the attic, it was Mrs. Slices. For a split-second Leaf forgot he was tied up and his heart skipped a beat. She was indeed a beautiful woman. How in the name of pig knuckles did Bryan ever get her? Leaf came back to himself; \u201cdid the doctors say there was no cure or was that your assumption?\u201d Mrs. Slices took over and begin to explain that each girl starting with the oldest had been to several doctors starting at the age of five. The Slices were assured that none of their other children would be affected by the disease, boy were they wrong. After Rebecca had died the couple decided to have another child believing the second child would be good.\nLeaf replied, \u201cMrs. Slices I am sorry for your loss but what does that have to do with me Ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cWell Sam was kind enough to find you for this exact day my boy. You will be needed to help transcend our girls back to this world again. All they will need is half of your heart. Rebecca needs the right and Rita needs the left.\u201d Leaf begins to squirm about, using all his strength to get free of his restrained. He only found himself tired. \u201cMy boy no need in that, please reserve your strength.\u201d Sam encouraged him.\nThis cannot be happening Leaf thought. What have I done to deserve this, he asked himself? Leaf went back n the recesses of his mind and truly tried to figure out what bad thing had he done to have been\nfound so worthy. Worthy? He thought more like so unlucky. He knew he had done some bad. He recalled in church the scripture whatsoever a man sows that he should also reap. Leaf could not recall ever sacrificing someone. What goes around comes around and the saying karma is a \u201cB\u201d? He again thought I have not been bad enough for this. What surprised Leaf is that the whole time though John, the Slices only son was there in the attic he had said nothing, not one word. Leaf thought that was strange, could this young man be prepared to take another\u2019s life? The Slices and Sam for that matter appeared to be sane. The word in operation however as Leaf thought, was appeared. Everybody appears to be a certain way until. Leaf was pushed into the middle of the room. Sam positioned the two caskets on either side of him. Sam announced that it was time and they had wasted more time than they should have. Sam stepped in between Rebecca\u2019s casket and Leaf. He faced the casket and slowly open the top, where the upper body would be seen. Leaf turned to look and there was nothing there. Sam came around and did the same to Rita\u2019s casket and again, it too was empty. Leaf could not believe his eyes. \u201cWhat in the Popeye the sailor man was going on?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaf was so confused, which made his anxiety even worse. You see son. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut your heart out and place the right side in Rebecca\u2019s coffin and the left in Rita\u2019s.\u201d Sam told Leaf.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNO!!!!! Leaf yelled at the top of his lungs as sweat poured from his face.\u00a0\u201cYou cannot do that.\u201d \u201cSomeone back home is going to miss me.\u201d\u00a0\u201cSomeone is going to miss you too Mr. Sawn.\u201d \u201cNo son, no one will miss me because I\u2019m going back home.\u201d Sam replied. \u201cNew York is a big place who will miss you?\u201d Sawn asked leaf so self-assured of himself. \u201cMy family you scum ball!\u201d Leaf angrily shouted.\nBryan went to the closet and pulled out a face cloth and a bottle of chloroform. He soaked the towel in the chemical. He then turned and walked toward Leaf. \u201cWait!!!! John yelled; I can\u2019t let you do this.\u201d \u201cDo what son? his mother asked. \u201cMother please\u201d, John turned and looked into her eyes, \u201cWe can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u00a0\nJohn knew even when he first met Leaf what could potentially happen. All Leaf had to do is not open the attic door. It was that small act of doing what he was told of him, that would have saved his life thought John. It had been talked about for years. His parents and uncle firmly believed that the sacrifice of another would bring his sisters back to them. John did not. This ritual had been passed down for generations. It was like a curse, but it wasn\u2019t. Any family could perform the ritual, you just had to believe. A boy for girl and vice versa. Leaf was chosen one because he was a boy. But what really got him on that gurney is that he broke the house rules. The ritual required a hardheaded soul and Leaf had that.\u00a0John could not let it happen. The reason it had taken so long for the ritual to take place was because unlike Leaf all others that had come to rent out the room, they had not broken the house rules. John knew that his parents\u2019 major problem is that had not grieved, and they just couldn\u2019t let go. Uncle Sam\u2019s only job was to get Leaf there and he did. John knew he had to do something because Leaf did not deserve to be sacrifice and doing se would not bring Rebecca nor Rita back. It would essentially be murder. \u201cMom, Dad, Uncle Sam he doesn\u2019t deserve this,\u201d as he placed his hand on Leaf\u2019s shoulder. Leaf laid on the gurney motionless taking everything in. \u201cLet him go and let the girls rest in peace.\u201d John pleaded with them. He knew he had to say that last part just so they would believe that he believed.\n\u201cNO, we\u2019ve waited so long, Bryan, said. \u201cSo long for what, to try and raised the dead?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been so busy trying to get someone to open this darn attic door that you forgot you had a live son just waiting for the love and attention you\u2019ve given two dead daughters.\u201d Lucy Slices walked over and slapped John across the face. John regrouped and maintained his stance, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to hurt Leaf.\u201d \u201cYou need a man take me but not him.\u201d \u201cYou know we can\u2019t use you, it has to be a non-relative,\u201d Bryan replied.\n\u201cBryan, John is right\u201d, Sam spoke up. \u201cThe girls are gone and there is nothing we can do about it.\u201d \u201cLeaf just happens to be a nosey young man.\u201d\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s nosey at work and I knew he would be no different here.\u201d He could not control himself.\u201d \u201cHis being nosey makes him a good reporter\u201d When Sam finished, he walked across the room and stood by John. \u201cI can\u2019t, we can\u2019t let you hurt this young man, banking on a curse that may or may not be true.\u201d \u201cThe girl\u2019s misfortune is just that misfortune.\u201d \u201cBut harming another won\u2019t bring them back, we can\u2019t do this.\u201d It\u2019s time to give yourselves to the one child that\u2019s here.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave, and he needs you too.\u201d \u201cHe needs you both more then the girls ever will.\u201d Sam continued with tears in his eyes. \u201cLucy Bryan let\u2019s let him go.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaf can only recall that it was like time stood still before either of them spoke a word.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Leaf had one drink two many and the worse of it was mixing it with Chantix. He was warned that it makes you have vivid dreams.\u00a0He was trying to stop smoking and his doctor prescribed this drug. Man, he thought as he woke up and gathered himself wiping the sleep from his eyes. He knew he had a shot or two or three or four of Tequila last night but didn\u2019t think much about it. This morning he had to move and quick. He needed to get to the office, like in an hour in a half. He had to kick butt. The good thing he had semi packed before he went out last night. His Mustang Shelby got him to the office in record time. He also had to thank decent weather and traffic was not bad either. He made it to the office and Mr. Sawn was there ready for him to go, ticket ready, hotel reservations made, camera equipment, ready. Leaf took off to Believe, PA, when he got there at, 7124 Maple Wood Cove, Mr. Bernard & Lauren Slices greeted him.\u00a0"}
{"title": "Voices In Her Head", "story": "Listen...\nIt was two am. The house was quiet. Emma padded down the stairs then checked every window and door on the first floor. She saw the alarm had been activated (by Robert) and let out a sigh of relief.\nThen she pulled her terry cloth robe tighter before making her way back upstairs.\nEmma had just gotten back under the down comforter when she heard it again.\nListen...\nEmma shut her eyes tight and placed her hands over both ears. I have to get some sleep tonight. She thought to herself.\nWhy was this happening again?\n***\nTwenty five minutes later, Emma was at the medicine cabinet in the master bedroom. She reached for the bottle of melatonin, swallowed two with a mouthful of water before returning to her queen size bed. She turned on her side and let out another sigh.\nIts either this or pacing the hall again tonight.\nThe trees outside the window danced in a rhythmic way. Emma wasn't sure if it was the graceful way they moved or the melatonin kicking in but soon she would drift off to sleep.\n***\nThe following morning, after a strong cup of coffee at the breakfast table, she prayed she would feel better today. A robin flew by the kitchen door. Emma admired the beautiful shades of brown on his coat and the deep red of his under belly. Maybe this is a good sign. The voice in her head told her.\nEmma sipped her coffee. She sat still. Took in the silence of the enormous old Victorian. Soon the house will be bustling with noise. It seemed important to let the calm wash over her. This would soothe her nerves plus get her through the weekend.\nEmma rose from her chair and set the coffee mug down in the porcelain sink. She reached for a rag (which she kept on the counter)then begun to wipe down the counters.\n***\nThe children entered the foyer first. Robert must've been gathering their belongings from his SUV. Celina (who was eleven going on fourteen) and Bobby(was eight but small for his age) were fighting the moment they came through the door. Emma left the kitchen in a hurry and greeted them both in the front hall.\n\"Mom, she hit me!\" Bobby wailed.\n\"He had it coming. He took my phone and read my texts messages...\" Celina chimed in.\nEmma cut her daughter off.\n\"You don't hit your brother! You know how I feel about that.\nDid you both have a good time?\"\nCelina rolled her eyes while never taking them off the screen of her phone. Bobby was wiggling out of his winter coat. Emma helped him remove his arms.\n\"I did! Dad took me to a baseball game.\"\n\"Wow that's great. You must've had fun. Celina, did you go with them?\" Emma inquired.\n\"No, I hate baseball. I stayed at Dads with Allie. I had homework. He said I it was ok.\"\nThe front door opened again. Robert( who stood at six foot three) entered. His arms were loaded with a suitcase, a large purple duffel bag plus snacks. He dropped the bags onto the hardwood floor.\nCelina was heading for the stairs. Bobby was talking so fast, Emma was having trouble keeping up.\n\"Um young lady, these are your things. Come and get them please.\"\nCelina stormed over and lifted her duffel bag over her shoulder. She made a face and puffed out a breath. This didn't phase Robert.\n\"Its heavy.\" She complained.\n\"I told you not to bring so much.\"\nCelina lugged it upstairs. Muttering the entire time.\n\"Whose Allie? And why was Celina spending time with her?\"\n\" Hello to you too Emma. I told you about Allie, I've been seeing her for six months now. Celina had work to finish. They weren't really together.\"\nEmma left Robert in the hallway.\n***\nEmma made a second cup of coffee along with a peanut butter sandwich for Bobby. Emma offered to heat up leftovers for her ex husband but he declined. She listened to Robert and Bobby discussing the Red Sox game in excruciating detail. They seemed to be reliving it right there at the table. Bobby would light up each time his Dad mentioned a home run or a grand slam. Baseball was something they had always shared.\nListen...\nNo. Not now. Leave me alone.\nEmma told the voice in her head.\n***\nEmma turned to face the counter with her coffee mug in her grip. She missed the edge and the mug smashed into pieces all over the tiled floor. Robert jumped up and hurried over to her.\nHe knelt down then started to gather the broken pieces together.\n\"Stay there Bobby! Its ok.\" Robert told him.\nRobert stood up with most of it in his palms. He noticed Emma's hands were shaking. She held tight to the counter. He whispered.\n\"Are you not feeling well again?\"\n\"I'm fine. Really I am. I set it too close to the edge, that's all.\"\nRobert took Emma by the hand and led her to the table.\n\"You take it easy. I can sweep that up.\"\n***\nEmma opened her eyes. The room was bright so she knew it was still early. A blanket lay on top of her. A knock at the door followed by Robert coming into her room. She began to sit up.\nHe walked closer to the bed.\n\"Did I wake you?\"\n\"No, I was already up. I promise you I'm fine. I would have canceled if I wasn't.\"\nRobert was along side the bed. Emma smiled at him.\n\"Its quiet. Are they outside or something?\"\n\"No, Mrs. Lewis stopped by to see you. When I told her you were asleep, she offered to take them to a movie.\"\n\"Oh Robert, this is my weekend. You should have told her no.\"\n\" This will give you a chance to tell me what's going on. I look at you and I can see your not right.\"\n\"There's nothing wrong with me. You worry too much. I've had some trouble sleeping but last night was better. I swear it. Did you put the alarm on?'\nHe looked confused but nodded anyway.\n\"Emma its me. I need the truth. I wont get mad and the kids can stay. Please, tell me.\"\nEmma sat and refused to answer. Robert placed his hand over hers.\n\"Tell me. Please.\"\n\" At first I thought it was someone in the house. I would search every room but found no one. Then I began to check the locks, the alarm, making sure it was always on. But I kept hearing it. A voice always at night. It sounds crazy, I know that. But if its not the TV or a person who broke in... it must be me.\"\nTears were rolling down Emma's face. She made no attempt to wipe them. Robert gave her hand a gentle squeeze.\n\"How long Emma? When did it start?\"\n\" A few days ago. I'm good during the day. I'm still working on my computer. It happens whenever I don't sleep.\"\n\"Have you gone back to Dr. Farber?\"\n\"No. It'll stop Robert. It has to. He will change my pills, run tests. I cant go through that...\"\n\"But your willing to live like this? No sleep, shaking, hearing voices! You have to go see him. That's not a request. How about today? They wont be back for hours.\"\n\"He isn't there late on Saturday. I can go Monday morning.\"\n\"That's too long. I want you to go today. I can drive you. Come on get dressed.\"\n***\nEmma sat in the waiting room. She flipped through pages of a magazine but wasn't able to concentrate. Robert paced behind her chair. \n\"Will you sit down your making me more anxious!\"\nRobert took a seat on the couch opposite Emma.\nEmma tossed the magazine on the wooden crate they were using as a side table.\n\"Does it always take this long?\"\n\"No, he must be busy. You insisted on coming today.\"\n\"Because I care about you and want you to get better.\"\n\"No you don't! You like me like this. Helpless and needy. Afraid of my own shadow!\"\n\"Stop it Emma. I know what your doing and its not going to work.\"\n\"And what am I doing exactly? Come on Robert, tell me I would like you to explain...\"\nThe door to the inner office opened and Dr. Farber walked out.\n\"What is going on out here?\" The doctor asked.\nEmma folded her arms.\n\"We didn't mean to be so loud. I'm sorry. It was my fault.\"\n\"Its perfectly alright. Its nobody's fault. Emma I'm ready you can come in.\" \n***\nRobert drove the thirty miles by himself. He had left the children with Allie. He took the elevator to the fourth floor. Then he headed down the hall to room 411. He steadied himself before entering the room. Emma was dressed sitting in a chair staring out the window. A nurse named Kelly was placing a small paper cup down on a tray.\n\"Hi, how is she today?\" Robert said.\n\"Not so good. She thought you weren't coming.\"\n\"I left late and the traffic was brutal.\"\nKelly grinned at him and left the two of them alone. Robert brought a chair over and sat beside her. Emma never took her eyes off the trees.\n\"I know I'm late. Boy its warm in here.\"\nRobert unzipped his winter coat. He looked around the room then back at Emma.\n\"I hate that your in here. The kids miss you. But I just don't think they can handle any of this. Bobby will cry I just know it. Emma, will you look at me?\"\nA long drawn out silence.\n\"I miss you too. We use to talk about everything. My job, your writing, the kids, money... I did this to you. This is my fault. You needed me and I was never ever there for you. I left you alone in that big old house.\"\nRobert wipes the tears away from his eyes.\n\"I'm so sorry. I want you to know that. You have nothing to worry about. Just get strong. I got the kids. They really are a handful sometimes. But I wouldn't trade them for anything. All you have to do is get better. Please, please get better. Come back to us.\"\nEmma turns from the window and touches Roberts hand. He is stunned.\n\"Hey, you wanna take a walk with me?\"\nEmma rises from the chair. He smiles at her.\n\"I would really like that.\" Emma says."}
{"title": "My Mother's Song", "story": "\t\n\t\t\t\tSunlight filtered in through the window. It scattered from wall to wall giving warmth to the cold, dusty air. I stood in the doorway, watching as the dust mites sparkled in the light and settled on my former belongings. My bed was situated right where it always had been. Pressed up against the far wall and wrapped in warm striped blankets and sheets. My desk was beside it, still carrying my piggy bank and white lamp. My posters were all hung up and the cloth ribbons draped around the ceiling. The window still shone on the far wall where, underneath it, glowing from the refracted sunlight, sat my piano. The wood was splintered and scratched but it welcomed me like a childhood friend. I walked over to the piano pressing into the soft carpet underfoot. The bench creaked as I sat down. I swept my hands over the aged wood. It rippled with my touch. Absorbing the warmth from my fingertips. I felt the grooves of my carved name on the right side. LIZZY. I traced each letter. The world was beginning to dissolve. I lifted the cover revealing the polished ivory. I placed my hands down gingerly. The keys felt soft. My muscles relaxed and without command or thought I began playing. The sweet melody began. My head began to swim. The peaceful comfort of the song set my mind dancing. The world completely dissolved. I was no longer at the piano. I was sitting on my bed watching my mother play. Her hands flowed through the air. The world gave no resistance to her playing. It welcomed it with open arms. My mom looked over at me and with sparkling eyes told me the same story she told me every night. The notes continued melting together as she spoke.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis song is special Lizzy. Do you know why it's special?\u201d She asked me. I knew the answer, but I let her keep talking. I loved hearing the story every night. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, I used to get bad dreams. I would wake up in the middle of the night and run to grandma. I would cry and cry until I crawled into bed with her and fell asleep. I kept having these dreams every night until one night grandma sat down at the piano next to my bed. She told me to listen to her song. She said it was a magical song. That as long as I heard it before going to sleep nothing could hurt me. She played the most beautiful song, she played it for me every night, and I never had another bad dream. Now I play it for you little Lizzy. So, I know that you\u2019ll be safe just like I was.\u201d I sat on my bed and listened believing with my whole heart every word my mom told me. I laid back and closed my eyes. The blend of notes fluttered through my thoughts like a soft breeze inside my head. I knew I was completely safe. The song eventually ended painting the room with a brilliant peaceful white. I opened my eyes one more time to see my mom leave the room saying, \u201cI love you, Lizzy\u201d and with nothing left to stop me, I drifted into a peaceful sleep. \n\t\t\t\tThe memory gently faded to the recessions of my mind. The present house formed around me again. My hands had stopped playing. Tears were rolling down my cheeks sparkling briefly before splashing on the keys. My mom would never play the song for me again. The thought was too painful to bear. A deep longing gaped in the pit of my stomach. I forced myself to play the song again but my hands resisted. The notes sounded awkward. The beautiful atmosphere my mom created was gone. The room felt cold. I begged my memory to take me away again but the notes I shot from the piano bore nothing more than sound. I wanted to scream. I threw my hands up to my face. The song stopped. The last notes rang out leaving nothing but silence behind. My body froze as I sat there. A pulsing frequency pounded my brain. My head felt as if it was falling into an infinite abyss. The world began to melt to black. Everything was disappearing. I sat there motionless losing track of time. The sun slowly fell taking its warmth and glow in the room as it went. The moon rose taking its place. Sending its ghostly haze to illuminate the room. I kept my eyes covered until I heard the steady rhythm of droplets cascading down the roof. I opened my eyes and out the window saw the pour of grey against the moonlight. The great roar of the rain pressed softly against my ears. The world began to reform. I wiped my eyes and placed my hands on the keys again. Comforted by the white noise of the rain I began to play. My hands moved without tension. The melody and bass collided and burst with energy whirling about the room. It fluttered to every corner and granted warmth to everything it touched. The piggy bank and lamp brightened. The light blue paint swirled and danced to the music. The bed sang with the tune it had heard so many times before. I continued playing and lifted my head to look out the window. I saw the energy from the song cut through the rain. Touching every raindrop, every leaf, every blade of grass until the outside began to sing to the melody of my mom\u2019s song. The music drifted up into the atmosphere. Brightening the night sky. I stretched my neck to look up at the stars. Each seemed to twinkle with the rhythm. At last, the song reached the moon. Brightening its haze covering everything with a brilliant peaceful white. A light smile appeared on my face. The song truly was magical. I finished the song and sat in the atmosphere I had created. My mom might be gone but her magic is still with me. I got up from the piano and walked to the doorway and before stepping out I turned around and said one final thing. \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d"}
{"title": "Rise Up, Rise Up.", "story": "\u201cListen Mark, it is really simple. Either use the hydrogen peroxide or don\u2019t, the choice is yours.\u201d\nMark blanched slightly, wavered momentarily, grabbed the brown bottle, carefully looked at the label and began reading.\nPerhaps it wouldn\u2019t be as bad as he imagined.\nPurified water -\u00a0check\nHydrogen peroxide 3% - check\nDirections: clean the affected area. Apply a small amount of product 1-3 times a day. - check\nWARNING: KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.\u00a0\u00a0-no problem\nFor external use only\u00a0- check\n\u201cHmmmm\u201d, Mark pondered, perhaps Ginny\u2019s request wasn\u2019t that bad an idea after all. It had be quite awhile since he\u2019d had sex with anyone and the only person who\u2019d handled his penis in quite some time was his doctor and...himself.\nFor Ginny it had been 30 years since she\u2019d last had her hands on a penis or had one enter any of her orifices.\nShe was somewhat reluctant to break her abstinence and yet there was something about Mark that sorely tested her resolve to leave the damned things alone.\nGinny had been married twice and so had developed an up close and personal\u00a0relationship with each husband's genitals.\nHer first husband, a Dutchman, was not very fastidious about cleaning his apparatus.\nGinny was young and rather innocent and several years younger than her domineering partner. She really had no idea that his demands for sex were anything she could control and asking him to bath first was unimaginable to her.\nHe wasn\u2019t a very generous lover and once his needs were satisfied, grunted with satisfaction, rolled off Ginny and fell sound asleep.\nThe act itself held some pleasure for her, but for the most part became a tedious task of enduring his efforts to achieve orgasm.\nShe knew exactly how many holes were in each of the ceiling tiles above her head.\n\u00a0Good sex had her hole count under 1000. Anything after that she simply zoned out from the experience and began planning how she could get the ice cream out of the freezer without Tony waking up.\nTheir marriage didn\u2019t last very long and she was grateful for the respite from the endless vaginal infections suffered from exposure to his rather unhygienic washing habits.\nAfter they separated, she lost a lot of weight, began drinking heavily and played the bar scene rather ruthlessly.\nIt was the early 1970\u2019s and the free exchange of sexual activity was not as frowned upon as it had been in her earlier years.\nGinny began to experiment. She rather enjoyed the process and decided perhaps penis\u2019 weren\u2019t as bad as she\u2019d imagined.\nThe problem was that, like her drinking, one never seemed to be enough.\nSo, after a year of experimenting she decided to quit. She\u2019d kept careful tabs of the number of encounters and had managed to keep the count down to the digits on her hands. She knew if she began on her toes, that she would never stop and that a dim future was in store for her.\nSo with firm resolve, she made a number of changes in her life.\nShe joined a religion that forbade its members to use alcohol and other drugs, frowned upon the use of tobacco and had strict laws regarding the guarding of one\u2019s chastity. NO SEX UNLESS MARRIED.\nIn one foul swoop, Ginny solved several problems. The biggest task in front of her was...to find a husband, thus ensuring her chances of once again having access to a penis.\nWell, as she\u2019d managed to keep her weight down, she found the perfect candidate.\nA good Catholic boy, who though had a history of promiscuous behaviour was agreeable to settling down to marriage and begin a family with Ginny.\nHe had a very nice penis and an admirable grasp of how to use it.\nThey were quite happy for several years, produced 3 children and though the seeds of destruction were present, Ginny failed to observe carefully. She hid much and so did her husband Joe.\nTheir marriage ended in catastrophe, with Ginny licking her wounds for several years, vowing to be much more careful in future attempts to handle any male apparatus.\nSomehow the years passed. It wasn\u2019t that she was adverse to having another relationship, she just was extremely cautious.\nShe sorely missed having a penis in her life but managed to find other substitutes and somehow, she came to discover that a penis, detached from a body, gave as much pleasure as one on a body. The added bonus was that her lovely latex lover was much easier to clean and made very few demands upon her time once its job was accomplished.\nOver the years, she made several attempts to seriously check out the market.\nIn her late 60\u2019s, she met a delectable male, who smelled deliciously like butterscotch. She did her best to entice him to have sex with her, but for some unknown reason he was reluctant to enter fully into the game. She tried for several years to tempt him and finally gave up, believing that she was destined to spend her remaining years penis free.\nIn her early 70\u2019s, she once again was tempted.\nShe met Mark in the alley behind her apartment. She was out in her garden when he wandered by, stopped to chat and they struck up an immediate friendship.\nMark was only 55 and though Ginny felt the magnetism of sexual attraction to him, managed to subdue any carnal inclinations with the realization that he could be her child. Unfortunately, the feelings she began to have for him were anything but maternal.\nThey managed to make it to her bed, she emerged after 1 hour and he several hours later.\nIt had begun quite innocently with her offering to give him a massage and check out what was going on with his kidney.\nOne thing led\u00a0to another, she finished the treatment, covered his snoring body with\u00a0a warm blanket and tiptoed out of the room and into her kitchen to continue on with her baking.\nWhen Mark appeared in the doorway several hours later, he announced that he\u2019d had the best sleep he\u2019d had in ages. He was amazed that he\u2019d been out that long.\nGinny smiled, she knew full well the powers of her bed and shared them with very few. To date, her grandchildren and on occasion, her grown daughter, were the only human beings who\u2019d been allowed to experience the\u00a0miraculous healing powers of her magic pallet.\nHer relationship with Mark expanded. She eventually informed him of her NON maternalistic feelings towards him and he seemed quite comfortable with the idea of advancing to another level.\nThe end came when she informed him of her requirements to have sex with her.\nMark was at first reluctant, but soon warmed to the plan and agreed to the conditions.\nGinny, in the meantime, was having second thoughts.\nShe valued her independence highly and was reluctant to enter into any relationship that interfered with that.\nIt wasn\u2019t that she was adverse to having a sexual relationship, only that she was hesitant to deal with all the baggage that came with it.\nShe left Mark her phone number and said to call her in a few days.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t\u00a0surprised when the call never came.\nLife went on much as before. She began dreaming of herds of penis\u2019 roaming freely across the range in search of refuge from the storm. She painted a few, sculpted a few and had a lot of fun with her faithful companion, Victor, a lovely pink latex vibrator that was always up to an adventure and rarely failed to do the job at hand. Best of all - he went into a drawer when the job was done...AFTER being cleaned with hydrogen peroxide.\nMany more years passed.\nGinny may or may not have found more live penis\u2019 and yet her life was complete and filled each day with adventure after adventure.\nShe woke daily with a deep sense of gratitude for having been given such a bountiful life and before her feet hit the ground, humbly begged her Higher Power to show her the best direction for the day and the strength to carry out His plans.\nCame the day she never woke up to this plane of existence.\nShe\u2019d gone to bed early and strangely enough, her final thoughts had been of Mark and the lovely hours they\u2019d spent together those many years before.\nThe last thing she remembered was looking at the hydrogen peroxide on her bedside table and sighing with satisfaction remembering her recent romp with her honey, Victor.\nThe next thing she knew, she was in front of a beautiful set of\u00a0pearly gates.\nThe Great One hovered before her, smiling lovingly as He welcomed her inside.\nShe bowed her head as He said, \u201cListen Ginny, I\u2019m going to make an exception in your case and allow you to bring ONE of your earthly possessions inside.\nGin looked down and lo and behold, at her feet was..."}
{"title": "The Old Man", "story": "Listen. I\u2019m going to tell you a story.\u00a0\n \nThere once was an old man who lived by himself in a dark forest. He hated water in large quantities and so lived in a place where the only water came from shallow pans scattered around his property. Every morning he walked to the poplar tree and carried the blue tin bowl inside. After making a weak rust colored tea, he would splash the remaining water over his head and sprinkle a little bit over his armpits. At night, he walked to the spruce tree and carried the yellow plastic bowl inside. For food, he ate tinned green beans and instant mashed potatoes. For entertainment, he had a portable hand-cranked radio that when the skies were clear received two stations very clearly and one station muffled by static.\n \nHe wasn\u2019t stupid, this old man, he was willing to suffer a little but not too much to humor his madness. There\u2019s a lesson in there for you.\n \nA boy came upon the shack. He knocked on the door and the door didn\u2019t open. The old man was listening to the radio and his eyes were closed, he might have been sleeping. On the table was a half-eaten bowl of white mush. The radio was playing Spanish jazz.\u00a0\n \nOld man! The boy shouted.\nThe old man opened his eyes and then closed it again.\nOld man! The boy shouted and for good measure kicked the door. The door opened, the old man stood shirtless in the doorway.\u00a0\n \nPut some clothes on, the boy said. He came in and turned off the radio. While the old man was digging through a pile of rags in the corner, the boy took out a long oblong shape wrapped in brown butcher paper from the plastic bag he was carrying.\u00a0The old man put on a dirty white shirt and tried to use his hands to smooth out the wrinkles.\n \nHere, eat this, the boy said.\u00a0\nI just ate, the old man said.\u00a0\nEat this, the boy said.\n \nSo the old man did. He unwrapped a hunk of meat from the butcher paper. Sprinkling some oil on a cast iron pan, he fried the entire thing and ate it without salt or bread. The boy sat by him turning the now useless buttons on the radio. They didn\u2019t talk, the only sound was from fork hitting plate, knife sawing through flesh, ill fitting dentures chewing on tough gristle.\u00a0\n \nClean up, the boy said after the old man was done. So the old man went outside and buried the butcher paper under the spruce tree, the fork and knife under the poplar. When he came back the boy was already gone. The old man should have been relieved but he wasn\u2019t.\n \nThe next day a man knocked on the door which promptly opened to reveal the old man standing in the doorway in a yellowed shirt and frayed black pants. There was a strong smell of onions and must. All people who live alone have to be vigilant against this odor but the old man had ceased to notice it for a long time now, or perhaps he had ceased to care. It is hard to tell the difference with him sometimes.\n \nHello sir, may I come in? The man asked. The two of them sat down at the kitchen table, the man sitting where the boy sat yesterday.\nHow are you doing sir? The man asked.\u00a0\nWell enough, the man said.\u00a0\nI heard that he came to see you yesterday.\nHe did come yesterday, but only for a short while.\u00a0\nDid he bring anything with him?\nNothing but some meat. It was good meat.\u00a0\nWhat did he bring it in?\u00a0\n \nIf you were listening, you would remember that the old man wasn\u2019t stupid, he wasn\u2019t going to tell this man anything important.\u00a0\n \nI don\u2019t remember, he said, some bag, it\u2019s not here now, he must have taken it back with him.\u00a0\nThe man nodded, he seemed to have been expecting this answer because he smiled.\u00a0\n \nHow do you get water out here? The man asked. The old man explained his system. The man asked more questions: why did the old man hate large bodies of water so much, where had he come from, what was his youth like? The old man talked and talked and talked until his tongue numbed and his words came out slurred and syncopated.\n \nI would love to see your property, the man said. The old man wasn\u2019t stupid, he wasn\u2019t going to show this man anything important.\u00a0\n \nIt\u2019s nothing, he said, nothing but trees.\u00a0\nWhat kind of trees?\u00a0\n \nThe old man described the beauty and variety of the temperate rainforest where poplars, spruces and birches came together to live in harmony in a damp and misty atmosphere. There\u2019s no place like this in the world, he said, I fell in love with the sound of my own movements.\n \nI love trees, the man said. I used to climb apple trees when I was younger. The old man said he used to climb trees as well, and broke a few bones doing so. They compared broken bones. The old man got up and showed the man a long scar on his side.\u00a0\n \nThey talked for a long time. When it got dark, the man shook the old man\u2019s hand and left. The old man should have been relieved but he wasn\u2019t.\n \nThe next morning, expecting a visitor, he used water from the blue tin bowl to wash his shirts and pants. While they laid damp and drying on a chair, he sat naked and shivering at the kitchen table. Someone knocked on the door.\u00a0\n \nOpen up, I know you\u2019re in there!\u00a0\n \nHe sipped his rust colored tea and waited. The knocking continued for a couple of minutes and then it stopped. The old man touched the sleeve of his shirt, still damp, a couple more hours to go.\u00a0The knocking started up again. The old man turned his head, as if listening to a far away noise. "}
